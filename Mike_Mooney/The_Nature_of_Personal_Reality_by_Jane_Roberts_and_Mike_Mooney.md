# The Nature of Personal Reality: Specific, Practical Techniques for Solving Everyday Problems and Enriching the Life You Know by Jane Roberts

## 01 | The Living Picture of the World

### Awakening Your Inner Power

Wake up, folks! It's *Mike Mooney* here, your transformational guide. Let's dive into the untapped reservoir of your mind and unleash the power within. You see, your world is a **three-dimensional painting**, a masterpiece crafted by your thoughts and emotions. Each stroke, each splash of color, mirrors what brews in the heart of your consciousness. 

### The Soul of the World

It's not just you, the whole cosmos is part of this grand orchestra. From the tiniest atom to the mightiest mountain, every bit of the universe resonates with the beat of consciousness. This is the melody of existence, the rhythm of life. Our thoughts, our feelings, they all contribute to this cosmic symphony. 

### The Mirror of Reality

Ever wondered why things happen the way they do? The answer lies within. Your exterior world is a reflection of your inner psyche. Like a mirror, it reflects your thoughts, emotions, and expectations. What you perceive as your reality is actually a projection of your inner self. 

### The Art of Self-Creation

You're not just a passive observer, my friends. You're an artist, a creator. You sculpt your physical image, your experiences, your reality with the chisel of your thoughts and emotions. You're the one pulling the strings. Remember, your inner self is the puppeteer, and your exterior world is the puppet. 

### Consciousness Uncovered

Our understanding of consciousness is still in its infancy. Psychologists, religious leaders, they've all tried, yet the true essence remains elusive. But one thing is clear: consciousness is the architect of reality. It's the force that molds the world, sculpts our experiences, and breathes life into our existence.

### The Power of Personal Reality

In Jane Roberts' enlightening book, "The Nature of Personal Reality", she reveals the secret of creating your reality. Our thoughts, feelings, and mental images are the paints we use to color our world. They shape our interactions, experiences, and our very existence. 

### Feelings: The Magnetic Force

Our feelings are more than just emotional responses. They're electromagnetic realities, influencing the atmosphere around us. Our thoughts and feelings cluster together, giving birth to events and circumstances. They are the seeds from which our physical reality sprouts.

### The Fabric of Existence

Beneath the surface of our day-to-day life, there are deep, characteristic feeling-tones that represent the core of our being. These feeling-tones are the source of our most creative impulses. Acknowledging and embracing them allows us to weave the fabric of our existence. 

### The Dance of Creation

The dance of creation is a two-step process. Consciousness leads, the physical world follows. We're not separate from nature; we're part of it. We're co-creators, shaping our reality within the framework of physical laws and assumptions. 

### Harnessing Your Greater Identity

Understanding your subjective world and your role in it is the key to unlocking your power. By reaching into the deeper knowledge of your greater identity, you can create joyous expressions in the physical world. After all, you're not just a drop in the ocean, you're the entire ocean in a drop. So, folks, it's time to let your inner power shine. Let's turn dreams into realities and make the impossible, possible!

## 02 | Reality and Personal Beliefs

### Unleashing the Power Within

Welcome, my friend! It's **Mike Mooney** here, your personal transformation guru. Let's dive into the profound wisdom about the power of our beliefs and how they shape our realities.

### The Ultimate Truth: Your Beliefs Shape your Reality

Let's start with this: *Your beliefs and expectations are the architects of your experiences and emotions.* Often, we accept our beliefs as absolute truths without giving them a critical thought. These beliefs, in fact, are assumptions that color our personal experiences. Our conscious thoughts can provide clues to these beliefs, and it's essential to recognize this. 

### Unmasking the Subconscious

Many people blame the subconscious for their problems and difficulties. But did you know that this belief leads people to shut off their inner selves and feel disconnected from their own reality? You can depend on seemingly unconscious parts of yourself, your body performs complex activities without your conscious awareness! 

### The Exercise of Self-Connection

Here's an effective exercise for you: sit quietly, close your eyes, and sense the deep feeling-tones within yourself. Trust your feelings. Do this exercise regularly and you'll start to connect with your inner depths.

### Our Environment and Us: An Unbreakable Bond

Our environment is an extension of ourselves, shaped by our thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. The physical interchange between our bodies and the space outside of us is in constant motion. Emotions and hormones can even affect the atmosphere and contribute to physical storms. 

### Let Go of Limiting Beliefs

You are what you believe! Any idea you accept as truth is a belief you hold. I encourage you to disregard beliefs that imply limitations. Life is not a valley of sorrows, your body is not inferior, you are not helpless before circumstances, and people are not inherently bad. 

### The Conscious Mind: Your Inner Director

Your conscious mind sets goals and the inner self brings them about. But be cautious, don't accept the beliefs of others without examining them. Your ideas and beliefs form the structure of your experience. You are responsible for your successes and joys. Be spontaneous, accept the free nature of your mind, and allow it to make decisions about the validity of the data it receives.

### The Power of Self-Examination and Acceptance

The conscious mind acts as a window through which we perceive and assess our individual and joint creations. But false beliefs often blur our perception and prevent us from experiencing joy, vitality, and accomplishment. To use our conscious mind properly, we must examine and evaluate the beliefs that come to us, both from within and from external sources.

### Your Conscious Beliefs: The Most Important Suggestions

Many false beliefs are accepted without examination, leading to a faulty picture of reality and hindering the inner self from fulfilling its role. When the inner self is alerted to this situation, it tries to remedy it by bypassing the conscious mind and finding self-corrective measures.

### The Ego and Conscious Mind

The ego directs the focus of the conscious mind. False beliefs can result in a rigid ego that distorts perceptions and limits the conscious mind's abilities. You must listen to your own train of thought and be aware of the suggestions and ideas you give yourself, as they will materialize in your personal experience.

### The Power to Shape Our Experiences

We have the creative power to form our own experience. We have the freedom to experiment, create, and alter conditions and events within those bounds. When the conscious mind accepts too many false beliefs, it closes itself off from the reminders of the deeper portions of the self and feels assailed by a reality that seems beyond its control. 

### Conclusion: The Power of Conscious Beliefs

Your conscious beliefs are powerful and play a pivotal role in shaping your reality. If your beliefs are beneficial, you will experience exuberance, health, abundance, and positive interactions with others. However, if your beliefs are faulty, you will experience poor health, lack of meaningful work, and a world filled with sorrow and evil. 

Remember, my friend, you hold the power to shape your reality. Start by examining your beliefs today!

## 03 | Suggestion, Telepathy, and the Grouping of Beliefs

### The Power of Beliefs

Seth takes us on a profound journey through the realm of beliefs in this chapter. He underscores that beliefs are not mere abstract ideas; they are vibrant, living entities with an **electromagnetic reality**. Our beliefs steer our emotions, and similar ones tend to flock together. 

Our ego, the most physically oriented part of our inner self, acts as the gatekeeper of our conscious mind and the bridge between us and the world. It formulates judgments about reality based on its self-perception. Although it appears static, the ego is fluid, constantly adapting and integrating new characteristics from the whole self. 

*Transcending limiting beliefs* and *embracing empowering ones* can significantly change your life experience. 

### The Role of Telepathy

In the grand scheme of things, Seth explains, telepathic information comes through deeper parts of the self, and the ego tries to organize this information for its purposes. Individuals react only to telepathic messages that align with their conscious beliefs. 

### The Manifestation of Personal Growth 

Jane Roberts shares a fascinating account of a manifestation she experienced after a trance, which seemed to represent a personality like Seth. This manifestation was a result of implementing the teachings from her ESP class and the book in her personal life. 

### Biological Foundations of Conformity 

Jane delves into the roots of conformity, using the example of an amoeba. The protoplasm in the amoeba represents the individualistic spirit, but it must conform to the amoeba's body to move as a unit. This example illustrates the implications of peer groups and conformity on a biological level. 

### Shaping Our Reality 

Seth talks about the nature of reality and how our conscious beliefs shape our perception of it. He emphasizes that our beliefs, both conscious and unconscious, shape our physical experiences. Our sense data reinforce our ideas and beliefs, whether they are positive or negative. 

### Core Beliefs: The Building Blocks of Our Lives 

Seth introduces the concept of *core beliefs*, our strong ideas about our existence. These beliefs profoundly influence our perception of events and shape our experiences. Recognizing both negative and joyful beliefs and using the feeling of accomplishment from successful experiences can transform areas of difficulty.

### The Interplay of Suggestion, Telepathy, and Beliefs

Roberts expounds on the interplay of suggestion, telepathy, and the grouping of beliefs. She emphasizes the importance of self-awareness in identifying our own beliefs and discarding those that do not serve us. 

### The Power of Imagination 

Roberts discusses the pivotal role of imagination in transforming our beliefs into physical experiences. The proper use of imagination can propel ideas in the directions we desire, helping us dislodge unsuitable beliefs and establishing new ones. 

### The Mystery of Creativity 

In a note, Roberts reflects upon the mystery of creativity, citing the example of Dick Bach, author of "Jonathan Livingston Seagull," who heard a voice that gave him the book's content. She believes that these states of heightened creativity tap into aspects of reality that are not yet fully understood. 

In conclusion, this chapter explores the role of beliefs in shaping our reality and highlights the interplay between conscious and telepathic communication. It also addresses personal concerns and provides guidance on how to change limiting beliefs. It is a call to examine our beliefs and take charge of our reality.

## 13 | Good and Evil, Personal and Mass Beliefs, and Their Effect Upon Your Private and Social Experience

### The Power of Beliefs: Unveiling the Invisible Forces

In our journey, we encounter different belief systems, sculpting our perception of ourselves and others. They can be a **double-edged sword**, nurturing prejudice and discrimination, or fostering enlightenment. Our beliefs mirror our thoughts on morality, spirituality, and even the fear of aging. The societal depiction of old age as a period of decline and loss of wisdom is a misconception, rooted in fear and misunderstanding. As I see it, **old age is a gold mine of opportunities for growth and fulfillment**. You have to embrace it without societal hindrances.

### Embracing Old Age: The Unseen Potential

Old age, like childhood, is a phase of creativity and spiritual growth. But societal beliefs often paint it in a grim light. I reflect on my father's old age and wonder if it was his choice or external factors that led to his circumstances. Regardless, his experiences serve as a reminder that **old age, like adolescence, can be a time of immense creativity**, often unnoticed. The chemical changes in our bodies during this period can lead to greater conceptions and experiences, although they may not have practical applications.

### The Psychedelic Experience: Beyond Conventional Beliefs

Delving into the psychedelic experience, it's challenging to explain within the confines of a limited belief system. In earlier civilizations, the elderly were cared for, their wisdom valued, with a harmonious body-mind relationship in old age. But modern societies have different beliefs about age. Western societies often view young adulthood as life's peak, while old age is seen as a period of decay. The conscious mind is valued for its critical abilities, leaving the creative aspects overlooked. But as we age, our minds grow freer, exploring different areas of creativity.

### Sleep Patterns: The Unseen Connection

Our sleep patterns are linked to our inner knowledge and contrasting values. By connecting seemingly diverse aspects of experience, such as light and dark, consciousness and unconsciousness, we can enrich our personal experiences. I propose a six-hour sleeping block with an optional two-hour nap. This schedule can bring about **greater intuition and applied knowledge**, as well as stability. Longer sleep periods are not necessarily beneficial for humans. There's a chemical give-and-take that's more effective in shorter sleep periods, and many people sleep through their most creative and alert periods.

### The Nature of Personal Reality: A New Perspective

Our beliefs shape our perception of reality and influence our behavior. Our wake-sleep patterns, which involve long periods of continuous waking conscious activity, disrupt the balance between conscious and unconscious material. This disruption leads to a division between the two aspects of experience and the emergence of beliefs that project repressed tendencies onto others. By changing our beliefs about unconscious activity and trusting ourselves, we can explore other states of reality and gain **greater self-understanding**.

### The Transcendent Experience: A Journey Within

In a transcendent experience, I realized we are all within God. This realization filled me with a sense of claustrophobia and security. During this episode, I experienced altered visual perception and bodily sensations. This experience was not just symbolic or artistic but felt like known facts. These "massive" experiences may have a connection with my previous encounters with spiritual entities. 

### The Influence of Societal Beliefs: Shaping our Consciousness

Societal beliefs have a profound influence on attitudes towards sleep, dreams, and alterations of consciousness. The focus on external achievements and material success often overshadows the inner creativity and experiences that occur in dreams. It's essential to realize that the inner self is conscious of the creative energy in dreams and is not influenced by superficial concepts of good and evil.
