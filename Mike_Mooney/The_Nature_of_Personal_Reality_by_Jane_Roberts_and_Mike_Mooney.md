# The Nature of Personal Reality: Specific, Practical Techniques for Solving Everyday Problems and Enriching the Life You Know by Jane Roberts

## 13 | Good and Evil, Personal and Mass Beliefs, and Their Effect Upon Your Private and Social Experience

### Embracing the Power of Beliefs

In the realm of personal and social experiences, beliefs hold a significant place. They shape our perception of the world and can give rise to prejudice and discrimination. Even those who consider themselves enlightened may unknowingly harbor prejudiced notions, using concepts like karma and reincarnation to justify inequality. **It is important to examine our beliefs critically and challenge their validity to foster a more inclusive and compassionate society.**

### Old Age: A Time of Growth and Fulfillment

Societal beliefs often project old age as a period of decline and loss of wisdom. However, such beliefs stem from fear and misunderstanding. In reality, old age brings new opportunities for growth and fulfillment, a fact often overshadowed by societal perceptions and lack of support for the elderly. **Just like adolescence, old age could be a time of great creativity, spurred by certain chemical changes in the body that lead to broader conceptions and experiences.** 

### Breaking Down Fear and Prejudice

Beliefs about race can inadvertently give rise to oppressive behaviors. The fear and oppression directed towards the black race, for instance, may spring from the whites' fear of their inner selves and the power they aim to suppress. It's crucial to remember that **all races and ages deserve respect for their unique contributions,** and limited value judgments should not apply.

### The Power of the Unconscious

The unconscious mind is a powerhouse of wisdom and creativity. By changing our sleep patterns, we can transform our perception of dreams and the unconscious. **Dreams contain wisdom and creativity,** and the unconscious mind is conscious and active in the dream state. 

### Embracing the Transcendent Experience

Transcendent experiences can offer profound insights into our existence. These experiences can make us feel connected to a greater power and give us a sense of being part of something massive and expansive. They can even alter our perception and make us feel connected to nature. 

---

**The ultimate takeaway is that our beliefs and perceptions shape our reality. By challenging our beliefs and embracing the power of the unconscious and transcendent experiences, we can foster a more inclusive society and realize our creative potential.**

## 14 | Which You? Which World? Your Daily Reality as the Expression of Specific Probable Events

### Constructing Your Reality

Life as we experience it is a reflection of specific probable events. It's our **brain** - the physical counterpart of the mind - that enables these nonphysical events to become physically valid. Our beliefs about ourselves form the self-image that dictates what we perceive as possible or impossible. Our daily reality is the manifestation of these beliefs. 

### The Power of Beliefs

The body's sense data is a mirror reflecting the beliefs that guide its actions. The practice of **hypnosis** is a testament to how altering beliefs can change our sense experience. Each person constructs their own world, and changes in belief can lead to a shift in perception. It's not a fixed personality that defines us, but our beliefs and experiences that constantly shape and reshape us. 

### The Role of Consciousness 

**Beliefs** play a crucial role in determining which events we experience. The sense of "I" is a result of the constant emergence of probable identities and it's the physical brain that limits and focuses this consciousness. The body retains memories of past events and is even aware of future occurrences, though this knowledge isn't consciously sensed. 

### The Influence of Past and Future 

Our present beliefs have the power to alter past experiences. This ability to reprogram the past means we are not victims of a past we can't control. **Consciousness** isn't limited by physical boundaries; it's a greater identity that arises from the collective consciousness of our body's atoms, molecules, cells, and organs. This consciousness is dependent on neurological activity, but its psychic structure is independent of the body. 

### Reinventing Our Lives 

Our daily reality is intimately connected with our beliefs and consciousness. Individually and collectively, we possess the ability to create "the best" of all possible worlds. By exploring our probable abilities and actions, we can enrich our daily experience and bring latent possibilities into our conscious awareness. 

---

**The power to shape your reality lies in your beliefs and consciousness. Change your beliefs and you change your world.**

## 15 | Which You? Which World? Only You Can Answer. How to Free Yourself From Limitations

### The Power of Belief and Your Multidimensional Self

The first thing we need to understand is that your **conscious beliefs shape your reality**. You have a multidimensional self, with a wide range of abilities and potentialities ready to be activated. You have chosen your current reality based on your beliefs, and by exploring these varied aspects of yourself, you can open up new possibilities. The author suggests visualizing and focusing on these potentialities, letting your desire bring them into reality. Remember, **you are not limited to one version of yourself**. 

### Active Decision Making and Its Impact

It all comes down to conscious decision making. Whether you choose to accept life as it comes, or declare yourself powerless, you are making a choice. The key is to **seize the direction of your own life**. Your path is not predefined; there are always other avenues to explore. Use your imagination to visualize these possibilities and bring them into being. 

### Your Present, the Point of Power

Your experience of the present is a potent point of power. It's where the material and spiritual meet. It's the platform from which you can influence both past and future. **The power to alter your life situation lies in the present**. However, there are limitations set by your physicality, but these should not deter you from making significant changes in your life. 

### Overcoming Limitations through Beliefs

External conditions, even diseases, can be changed if you understand the principles being discussed. The crux of it is that **your physical circumstances automatically change as your beliefs change**. Each challenge you face is a barrier to overcome, and each aspiration you have is an admission of a lack. Embrace this understanding and use it to your advantage. 

### Age and Perception

In many cultures, age is not a significant factor. However, our societal beliefs about age can be limiting. Counteract this by drawing upon qualities and knowledge from your past or future. **Your beliefs about age will manifest in your personal experience**. 

### The Impact of Loneliness and Depression

Feelings of loneliness and depression are created by your beliefs. Temporary relief might come from better nutrition or medical attention, but a lasting solution can only be achieved by changing your beliefs. The present moment is the point of power where you can alter the past, its beliefs, and their reactions. 

**Remember, the point of power is in the present, and from that moment, you choose which version of yourself and which world you want to experience. The choices you make affect not only you but also the world around you. Use your power wisely.**

--- 

**The power to alter your life situation lies in the present. Seize this point of power and use it to shape your beliefs and, consequently, your reality.**


## 16 | Natural Hypnosis: A Trance Is a Trance Is a Trance

### The Power of Perception and Belief

In "The Nature of Personal Reality," Jane Roberts delves into the concept of reality and how our perception shapes it. She posits that our **physical life is a focused entrancement**, with our senses dictating the version of reality we experience. However, she emphasizes that this is just one facet of reality, not the entirety. 

### Utilizing Natural Hypnosis

Roberts highlights the role of **natural hypnosis** in shaping our experiences, explaining that our beliefs and conscious thoughts significantly influence our reality. She proposes that by focusing on a simple statement and repeating it, individuals can activate biological patterns and reflect them in their experiences. It's crucial, however, not to strain or spend too much time on this exercise as it may reinforce the idea of problems. 

### The Unconscious Mind and Belief Systems

Roberts elucidates the role of the unconscious mind in accepting conscious beliefs. She points out the importance of questioning and examining our beliefs, especially in areas where we are dissatisfied. Conflicts between desires and beliefs can hinder the manifestation of desired outcomes. In the case of formal hypnosis, individuals temporarily suspend their own beliefs and accept those of the hypnotist. 

### Natural Hypnosis in Health and Wellness

Roberts affirms that natural hypnosis can improve one's life, and even in primitive societies, therapists have used it to concentrate energy and focus on the present moment. She criticizes Western medicine for its focus on disease rather than health and emphasizes that individuals have the power to change their beliefs and improve their lives through natural hypnosis. 

### Belief Systems and Physical Health

Roberts emphasizes the importance of belief systems in relation to health and illness. She explains that our beliefs shape our actions and behaviors, and they can influence our body's response to certain stimuli. She also discusses the role of the mass system and societal beliefs in shaping our health, cautioning against the fear and anxiety created by specific health campaigns. 

---

**The power of belief systems in shaping our physical health and reality cannot be overstated. By understanding the role of natural hypnosis and consciously choosing empowering beliefs, individuals can take control of their health and create a more positive and fulfilling life experience.**


## 17 | Natural Hypnosis, Healing, and the Transference of Physical Symptoms Into Other Levels of Activity

### Your Body, Your Masterpiece

Your body, in many ways, is a **living sculpture**; it's a testament to the artistry of life. Like any work of art, it undergoes changes, some of which may be unpleasant. However, the healing power within you can help you turn that around. 

### The Power of Social Transference

Some people, after a long period of illness, suddenly recover and throw themselves into beneficial social endeavors. This is a form of **positive transference** where they channel their physical symptoms into the social structure. They're not just healing themselves; they're healing their communities too.

### The Lost Notes of Sleep

Many a time, we get flashes of insight in our sleep but wake up to find them vanished. This could be an intriguing area to tap into, as it could hold valuable insights about personal reality, power, faith, belief, and creativity.

### Problems as Catalysts for Creativity

Personal problems, often seen as hurdles, can be *powerful catalysts for creativity*. Social workers, for example, use their personal challenges as impetuses to create social changes. In other words, they turn their lemons into lemonade. However, it's crucial to remember that not all creative acts stem from individual problems or neuroses.

### The Dual Nature of Love

Love can temporarily boost an individual's sense of self-worth by taking it from another. But a **greater love** involves two individuals who know their worth and can give and receive without taking from the other. 

### Reality, Beliefs and Natural Hypnosis

Reality, in many ways, is a reflection of our beliefs. Through **natural hypnosis**, we tend to seek out situations that confirm our beliefs and steer clear of those that threaten them. 

### The Illusion of External Power

Believing that one is being cursed by another person is an illusion. This illusion stems from a sense of powerlessness and an abdication of personal responsibility. It's essential to recognize that **our power resides within us**, not in external sources.

### The Power of Thoughts on Body and Life

Our thoughts have a profound impact on our bodies and lives. Negative thoughts can lead to physical symptoms, while positive thoughts can lead to healing and growth. The key is to **cultivate a positive mindset** and to understand the power of our thoughts.

---

**The takeaway here is that our reality is shaped by our beliefs, and our power resides within us. By recognizing and utilizing this power, we can create a positive change in our lives and communities.**

## 18 | Inner Storms and Outer Storms. Creative "Destruction." The Length of the Day and the Natural Reach of a Biologically Based Consciousness

### The Consciousness of Reality

In the realm of personal reality, our **consciousness plays a vital role in interpreting our awareness**. Through our neurological structure and physical body, we perceive different kinds of memory. Some are readily available to our conscious mind, while others are stored in our unconscious. Our consciousness is linked to the rhythms of our planet, which is composed of atoms and molecules with their own consciousness. When we think, chemical interactions occur in our bodies, storing memories in their flow. 

### The Power of Emotions and Beliefs

Our feelings significantly influence our environment. They have **electromagnetic properties that affect the atmosphere**. Just as our bodies must rid themselves of chemical excesses, the Earth must clear itself of excess water. Our beliefs direct and generate feelings, which are compared to man-made structures like buildings. 

### The Connection Between Inner and Outer Storms

Natural disasters serve as a **reflection of our inner emotional state**. They remind us of our connection with the planet and our own power. People living in earthquake-prone regions may unconsciously attract themselves to the constant stimuli and excitement. 

### The Choice of Life and Death

**No one perishes in a disaster without choosing to do so**. This choice dictates the way and time of death. Our bodies are aware of impending natural calamities on levels other than conscious, and defenses are set up. Some individuals will use their unconscious precognition to save themselves. 

### The Lessons From Natural Disasters

Natural disasters and wars can teach individuals important lessons. They remind us of our **connection with the planet and our own power**, while wars teach us to revere life. Both experiences provide contact with the deepest energies of our being, even if they are being used destructively. 

### The Power of Change

A flood represents the washing away of the old and the emergence of new birth. It serves as an encounter with nature, allowing individuals to experience their own identities and strengths. 

---
**The profound takeaway from this text is the understanding that our consciousness and emotions significantly influence our reality, and our choices dictate our life experiences.**

## 19 | The Concentration of Energy, Beliefs, and the Present Point of Power

### Embrace the Power Within

Jane Roberts affirms that our **beliefs shape our reality**, both positively and negatively. We choose our life situations, often before birth, consciously manifesting them as physical or mental challenges. These are not limitations, but opportunities for personal growth and exploration. Remember, **our beings are not seeking a problem-free state, but new experiences and challenges**. 

### Multi-dimensional Existence

Roberts emphasizes that **all existences are simultaneous** and our present beliefs and actions have the power to alter our past and future experiences. We exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously, connected through electromagnetic energy patterns. Our consciousness is unique and independent, and each individual has the potential to draw upon the energy and powers of their entity.

### The Interplay of Energy and Time

The author goes on to explore the concept of time and energy, indicating that certain periods are more potent for communication in the dream state. These communications can lead to significant decisions and have a larger impact on historical changes. **Each day represents both an entire lifetime and many lives in one**, and holds the answers to our current problems.

### Power of Imagination

Roberts underscores the importance of trusting one's imagination. She suggests that **problems can be worked out through the use of imagination**, and imagination can be constructively used to alter the past, present, and future. By using imagination effectively, one can creatively alter probabilities, find solutions to problems, and draw out unconscious experiences from other simultaneous lives.

---

**Your life situations are not limitations, but contexts through which you can explore and express your true self. You have the power to shape your reality through your beliefs and imagination.**


## 20 | The Dream Landscape, the Physical World, Probabilities, and Your Daily Experience

### Harnessing the Power of Dreams

In "The Nature of Personal Reality" by Jane Roberts, the author delves into the profound connection between dreams, physical realities, and the art of problem-solving. Dreams, as Roberts explains, are **unique translations of physical experiences**. Unlike waking life, where beliefs take time to materialize, the dream world instantaneously brings probable acts into existence. Dreams aren't meant to mirror daily life - they operate on a different set of rules, providing a playground for the mind to explore, create, and solve problems freely.

### Dreams as a Gateway to Awareness 

Roberts suggests that there is no need for a vast separation between waking and sleeping lives. By consciously stepping into the dream state, one can access **expanded awareness and underutilized unconscious knowledge**. She advises readers to embrace their dreams as a wellspring of creativity and a reservoir of solutions. 

### The Intersection of Dreams and Reality

Roberts further explores the interplay between dreams and the physical world. She posits that dreams and probable dream events lay the groundwork for our physical reality. Even historical events like wars are fought and decided in the dream world before manifesting physically. She argues that dreams offer a broader perspective and freedom from time and space constraints, enabling us to create solutions that may not seem immediately appealing but prove highly inventive in the long run.

### Dreams as a Blueprint for Reality

Roberts asserts that in the dream state, our beliefs guide us towards events that align with our reality. However, as multidimensional beings, there are other dynamics at play. Our entire being holds condensed knowledge that cannot be fully expressed in our physical consciousness. In dreams, we get glimpses of our greater existence through symbolic imagery and fantasies. These dream experiences serve as blueprints for the physical reality we wish to manifest.

---

**The most important takeaway is that dreams are more than just passive nighttime experiences; they are powerful tools for problem-solving, creativity, and personal growth. Harnessing their power can lead to profound transformations in our waking lives.**

## 21 | Affirmation, Love, Acceptance, and Denial

### Embrace Your Uniqueness

Jane Roberts delves into the concept of **affirmation**, which is all about saying "yes" to your unique self. It doesn't mean accepting all that is thrown your way, but rather appreciating and embracing your vitality and individuality. Your physical health, too, is deeply influenced by your beliefs and behavior. Affirming the goodness of your physical being promotes health and wellbeing.

### Emotion: The Untamed Beast

The text further explores the concept of **denial**. It's not about suppressing negative emotions, but rather acknowledging the integrity of your experiences. Negative emotions aren't inherently evil, they simply exist. Suppressing them can lead to barriers, blocking the free flow of energy. It's crucial to allow yourself to fully experience and express your emotions, even the uncomfortable ones.

### The Unconventional Wisdom of Hatred

Hatred, often seen as destructive, is not inherently evil. It's a natural emotion that can instigate change and action. Violence often erupts not from hatred, but from a sense of powerlessness. Suppressing aggressive tendencies and negative emotions can lead to an explosive outburst of pent-up emotions, and even violence.

### The Power Play of Nations

Delving into the socio-political sphere, the text touches on how a sense of powerlessness can lead nations to wage wars. The Second World War and subsequent conflicts were fueled by such feelings and the desire to assert power and control. This sense of powerlessness persisted, and violence continued to be an outlet for expressing pent-up emotions.

### The True Nature of Love

Roberts takes an in-depth look at **love** and **hate**, explaining that both arise from self-identification. Hatred is not a denial of love, but an attempt to regain it. She cautions against belief systems that advocate rising above emotions, emphasizing that emotions are an integral part of our human nature. Even hateful thoughts can ultimately lead to a reconciliation and release of love.

### The Power of Self-Acceptance

Affirmation extends to accepting oneself and saying "yes" to one's own being. It's about recognizing your reality as a spirit in flesh, and expressing your desires and feelings. True humility lies in appreciating oneself and recognizing the individuality and self-worth in all beings. Those who fear to affirm their own being also fear to let others live for themselves.

### Unleashing the Power of Affirmation

Affirmation involves rejecting the perceptions of others to shape one's own beliefs. By affirming oneself, one attracts the specific kind of information, experience, or perception that is needed. Roberts gives an example of Ruburt, who asserted his unique creative and intuitive processes, thereby developing his psychic and intuitive powers.

### The Spacious Mind

Roberts introduces the concept of the "spacious mind", an accelerated range of action where the mind operates. Through affirmation of self, the brain can tune into the spacious mind and access its perceptions. She highlights that individuals carry within themselves structures pointing towards future evolution, and the use of the spacious mind involves these structures, allowing for a different kind of awareness.

---
**The key takeaway from this text is the importance of self-affirmation and acceptance in shaping our reality and future. It's about embracing our individuality, expressing our emotions freely, and harnessing the power of our minds to shape our reality.**

## 22 | Affirmation, the Practical Betterment of Your Life, and the New Structuring of Beliefs

### Embrace Your Uniqueness and Potential

Life is all about recognizing your worth and utilizing your unique talents to fulfill your potential. It's essential to understand that your beliefs about yourself govern your reality. **You are not what you believe you are; you are what you allow yourself to be.** It is not enough to merely repeat positive affirmations - you must truly believe in them and in yourself. Write down your feelings and beliefs about yourself and compare them to your achievements and abilities. This will help you understand your unique worth.

### The Art of Self-Reflection

It is critical to regularly examine and restructure your beliefs. Beliefs evolve over time and while they may serve a purpose for a period, they can also become restrictive. Reflect on your beliefs and understand why negative beliefs arise; work with them, not against them. **Your power lies in the present; you have the ability to change your beliefs and shape your reality.**

### Solving Everyday Problems 

Jane Roberts explores practical techniques for solving everyday problems and enriching life. It's important to implement your desires practically instead of merely dreaming about them. Trust your abilities and your present situation. Seek help from others, but don't shirk responsibility for your personal growth and understanding.

### Affirmations and Self-Love

Affirmation can be a powerful tool for improving your life. Affirming your worth can weaken opposing beliefs. It's crucial to love yourself and others without constantly comparing yourself to an ideal. List specific incidents that make you feel guilty; these can often be traced back to early childhood beliefs. By bringing these beliefs to light, you can dissolve them and comprehend yourself better.

### Trust Yourself and Embrace Cooperation

Trust yourself and recognize your uniqueness. This will allow you to cooperate with others and encourage their talents. Both physical and spiritual aspects of life are interconnected. **The deepest knowledge comes from within; while others can provide valuable insights, your consciousness is unique and untranslatable.**

---

**Ultimately, take responsibility for your growth and understanding, trust in your abilities, affirm your identity, and remember, you have the power to create your own reality. There are no limitations except those you believe in.**
