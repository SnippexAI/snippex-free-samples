# Rework by Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson

## 01 | Introduction

### Embracing Unconventional Wisdom
"Rework" is a unique take on business, crafted by 37signals, a profitable software company. Their success story isn't built on traditional business norms. Instead, they **challenge conventional wisdom** and think differently.

### The Birth of 37signals
Starting as a web-design consulting firm in 1999, 37signals created Basecamp, their project-management software. This became their primary product and a significant revenue source. Despite being seen as an internet company, they pride themselves in their small size, frugality, and profitability.

### Rethinking Business Norms
Rejecting the idea that growth, meetings, budgets, and advertising are prerequisites for success, they **advocate for building products that do less than the competition**. Decisions are made on the go, challenging the standard business practices.

### Proving Critics Wrong
They address critics doubting their unconventional methods and advise others to ignore such skepticism. Their **success serves as a testament to the efficacy of their unconventional approach**.

### A Roadmap to Rethink Business
The book offers a comprehensive guide on rethinking and rebuilding businesses. It covers starting out, needing less, launching, marketing, hiring, and maintaining control.

---
**The ultimate takeaway: Success can be achieved by challenging traditional business norms and embracing an unconventional, minimalist approach.**

## 02 | First

### Embracing the New Business Reality

"Rework" inspires you to **embrace the new business reality**. Accessible tools and technology empower anyone to start their own company.

### Redefining Work Ethics

Fried and Hansson challenge traditional beliefs, asserting that **excessive risk and long hours are unnecessary**. It's possible to create successful side businesses while maintaining a day job.

### Practical Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

The book is a treasure chest of **practical advice for aspiring entrepreneurs**, small business owners, or those yearning for change. It urges readers to rethink their approach to work.

---

**The key takeaway: Rethink work, embrace new business realities, and know that success doesn't require risking everything.**

## 03 | Takedowns

### The Illusion of the "Real World"

In the face of traditional thinking, the authors of "Rework" challenge the notion of the **"real world"** as a limiting and pessimistic mindset. They believe it's a place where change meets resistance, where innovative ideas are dismissed as risky or impossible. They urge you to reject this reality and believe in your ideas.

### The Real Value of Success

The authors debunk the overrated concept of learning from mistakes. Instead, they advocate for **learning from successes**, emphasizing that success, not failure, equips you with practical knowledge of what works. They cite studies showing that successful entrepreneurs have higher probabilities of succeeding again, while failure doesn't necessarily breed success.

### The Art of Business Improvisation

Long-term business planning is seen as mere guessing due to numerous uncontrollable factors. The authors suggest treating plans as flexible guesses rather than rigid blueprints. They stress the importance of **improvisation and adaptability over rigid planning**. 

### Size Doesn't Measure Success

The universal goal of business growth is questioned. The authors argue that finding the right size for your business and maintaining it is perfectly fine. They discourage rapid growth and premature hiring, promoting the idea that **being a small, profitable business is a commendable achievement**.

### The Myth of Workaholism

Workaholism, often seen as dedication, is criticized. The authors argue that long working hours are not sustainable and can lead to crises and poor morale. They believe workaholics often waste time on minor details, compromising sharp decision-making. 

### Embracing "Starters" Over "Entrepreneurs"

Lastly, the authors suggest replacing the term "entrepreneur" with "starters". They believe that those who start a business should be recognized and encouraged, regardless of fancy titles or credentials. All that's needed is an idea, confidence, and the motivation to start.

---

**Remember, the only "real world" is the one you create. Success is the best teacher, adaptability is key, size does not determine success, work smart not hard, and be a proud 'starter'.**

## 04 | Go

### The Power of Impact and Urgency 

Seize the day, folks! Making a meaningful impact and creating something that matters is a game-changer. You've got to stoke that fire of urgency and **be the change** you want to see. Companies like Craigslist and The Drudge Report didn't wait for others; they made waves of impact with small teams. Remember to do something that matters in your industry. 

### Your Itch, Your Innovation 

The secret to a great product or service? **Scratch your own itch**. Inventors like James Dyson, Vic Firth, and Mary Kay Wagner solved their problems and created successful products. They knew the quality of their creations because they were the first users! 

### The Art of Execution 

Ideas are a dime a dozen, but **execution is gold**. Don't wait for the perfect time - start creating now. If Stanley Kubrick waited for the right time, we wouldn't have 'The Shining'. Prioritize your time, make sacrifices and achieve what you want. 

### Stand for Something 

In the business world, a strong point of view is crucial. **Stand for something**. It attracts superfans, creates passionate advocates, and simplifies decision-making. Companies like Basecamp and Whole Foods have thrived by doing this. 

---

### The Authentic Mission Statement 

**Genuine mission statements** are essential. Don't pen down words you don't believe in. Always remember, actions speak louder than words. 

### The Perils of Outside Funding 

Outside funding is not a magic wand. It can lead to loss of control and a short-term vision. So, entrepreneurs, be frugal, start small. You don't need a large team or a big office to make it big. Remember, Apple started in a garage. 

### Profitability over Popularity 

The market doesn't care if you're a startup or a decades-old company, **revenue and profit are the real deal**. Don't get so caught up in the startup frenzy that you forget to build a profitable business. 

### The Flexibility of Less Mass 

A lean business is a nimble business. Avoid long-term contracts, excess staff, and permanent decisions that increase mass and make change difficult. Being able to **quickly change business models, products, and priorities** when necessary is a huge advantage. 

---

**In conclusion, focus on making an impact, solving your own problems, taking action, standing for something, and building your business thoughtfully and deliberately. Prioritize long-term sustainability, customer satisfaction, and profitability over short-term gains and external validation. Remember, the key to success is in your hands.**

## 05 | Progress

### Embrace Constraints: The Key to Innovation

The book "Rework" emphasizes the value of constraints in promoting **creativity and efficiency**. It's about leveraging what you have, and the beauty of limited resources is they compel you to come up with innovative solutions. A business like Southwest Airlines is a classic example of this, thriving on a business model of flying only one type of aircraft, hence reducing costs and simplifying operations.

### Less is More: The Art of Focusing

The authors also caution against trying to do everything at once. The quest to do everything often results in a mediocre product. They suggest **focusing on executing half a product excellently** rather than delivering a full product half-heartedly. The key is to prioritize, cut back on non-essential ideas and concentrate on delivering a high-quality product or service.

### Start at the Epicenter: Building a Strong Foundation

Starting at the epicenter of an idea or business is crucial. It involves identifying the core element of your idea or business and channeling your efforts on improving it. This approach helps to prioritize efforts and ensure a solid foundation for your venture.

### Action Over Perfection: The Power of Decision Making

The authors stress the importance of **making decisions and taking action**. Procrastinating on decisions leads to unresolved issues and stalls progress. Commit to making decisions and moving forward, even if things aren't perfect. The momentum and morale generated by a rhythm of decision making can be a powerful motivator.

---

**The essence of "Rework" lies in embracing constraints, prioritizing, and taking action. The core of a successful business is built around unchanging principles. The tone of a product comes from the individual using it, not the tools. The real value lies in the message, not the medium used to deliver it.**

## 06 | Productivity

### Reality over Illusions

In the cycle of business, **documents and reports often create illusions of agreement**. As the authors of "Rework" suggest, replace these abstractions with real, physical prototypes or visuals. For instance, Alaska Airlines built a mock lobby with cardboard boxes to design their efficient Airport of the Future.

### The Art of Questioning 

It's crucial to **question the work you're doing**. Is it solving a problem? Is it adding value? Don't be afraid to abandon work that isn't worth it. 

### Minimizing Interruptions 

**Interruptions are productivity killers**. Often, staying late and working weekends is the result of not getting enough done during regular hours due to interruptions. Find alone time to focus, avoid communication addiction, and use passive communication tools.

### Rethinking Meetings

Meetings can be toxic interruptions. They often waste time and convey little information. **Make your meetings more efficient** by setting a timer, inviting fewer people, having a clear agenda, and ending with a solution. 

### Simple Solutions Win

Complicated solutions to problems are unnecessary. More often than not, **simple, mundane solutions are sufficient**. Seek maximum efficiency with minimum effort. Focus on completion, not recognition. 

### The Power of Good Enough 

When good enough gets the job done, go for it. **Momentum is crucial for motivation and progress**. Achieve small victories to maintain it. Understand that sometimes quitting is better than continuing on a path that isn't working. 

### The Need for Sleep 

Don't sacrifice sleep for extra work hours. Lack of sleep can lead to stubbornness, diminished creativity, and low morale. **Prioritize sleep**. 

### Accurate Time Estimates 

Estimating time accurately can be challenging. **Break down projects into smaller tasks** to make estimation easier. Prioritize visually, focus on the most important task, and make small decisions for flexibility.

---

**In a nutshell, focus on what truly matters. Eliminate distractions, question your work, minimize interruptions and meetings, find simple solutions, maintain momentum, prioritize sleep, and make small decisions. This is the path to increased productivity and success.**

## 07 | Competitors

### Shun the Copycat Syndrome

In the business world, **copying is a recipe for mediocrity**. It leaves you in a passive position, always chasing after the original innovators. By pasting someone else's ideas, you deprive yourself of the growth that comes from learning and understanding.

### Inject Uniqueness into Your Offerings

To stand apart, **embed your unique thinking into your product or service**. Companies like Zappos and Polyface thrive by offering experiences that are unreplicable by competitors. By injecting CEO Tony Hsieh's customer service obsession, Zappos provides a unique customer experience. Similarly, Polyface sells not just chickens but a mindset.

### Pick a Battle with Your Competitors

**Differentiating yourself as the anti-something can give you direction and attract supporters**. Dunkin' Donuts positioned itself against Starbucks' pretentiousness, while Audi declared itself a fresh alternative to old luxury brands.

### Underdo Your Competitors

Sometimes, **solving the simple problems and leaving the difficult ones to the competitors** proves successful. Products like fixed-gear bicycles and Flip camcorders gained popularity by doing less, but doing it well.

### Focus on Self-Improvement 

Rather than obsessing over your competitors, **focus on improving yourself and your own vision**. Redefine the rules of the game and offer something fresh. Fighting for what you believe in is better than imitating others.

---

**In business, standing out is paramount. Embed your unique thinking into your offerings, differentiate yourself, solve simple problems, and focus on self-improvement. Don't be a copycat, be an original.**

## 08 | Evolution

### Embrace The Power of 'No'

**Saying 'no' is vital for a successful business**, even when faced with good ideas. It is uncomfortable but necessary to prevent getting sidetracked working on ideas that don't align with your vision. When you say 'yes' to everything, your important tasks get buried under a pile of distractions.

### The Customer Isn't Always Right

Contrary to popular belief, **the customer isn't always right**. The authors use ING Direct as an example, a bank that flourished by rejecting customer requests for added services. It's crucial to have a product aligned with your vision, even if it means turning down customer requests. Avoid trying to appease a single big customer at the expense of your general clientele. When you overly cater to one customer, you risk alienating others and stunting your growth.

### Don't Confuse Enthusiasm with Priority

The authors warn against mistaking enthusiasm for a new idea as its true priority. Allow ideas to cool down before pursuing them to gauge their actual relevance. 

### Aim for "At-Home Good" Products

Strive to create products that are "**at-home good**." These are products more satisfying and impressive to use at home than they seemed in the store. Focus on delivering a great user experience over flashy features or packaging.

### Forget Keeping Track of Customer Requests

Discard the practice of logging customer requests. The requests that genuinely matter will resurface from various customers. If a request keeps getting forgotten, it is likely unimportant. 

---

In conclusion, **prioritize your vision and beliefs, say no to distractions, and focus on creating products that deliver a great user experience**.

## 09 | Promotion

### Cultivating Obscurity: A Business's Best Friend

In the early stages of a business, obscurity provides a safety net for **experimentation and learning** without the fear of public scrutiny. This phase allows businesses to test their products and performances in smaller markets before going mainstream. 

### Building an Audience vs. Advertising 

Instead of spending large sums on advertising, businesses should focus on **building a loyal audience**. An audience is a group of customers genuinely interested in what a business has to say. By sharing valuable information, businesses can attract and retain this audience, saving money on traditional advertising.

### Out-Teach Your Competition

Businesses should aim to **educate and provide value** to their customers. By teaching customers about their products or industry, businesses can build trust and loyalty, setting themselves apart from the competition. 

### Sharing Expertise: A Unique Approach

Businesses should not be afraid of sharing their expertise. It is difficult for competitors to replicate a business's unique approach and execution. Sharing knowledge can help businesses **build a connection with their customers** and establish themselves as experts in their field.

### Embracing Authenticity and Imperfection

Businesses should not shy away from showing their genuine self. By being real and relatable, businesses can create a stronger connection with their customers. 

### The Fallacy of Press Releases

Instead of using generic press releases, businesses should take a more personal approach to pitching their stories to the press. A **genuine and meaningful approach** can increase their chances of getting coverage.

### Alternative Marketing Strategies

The authors suggest focusing on trade publications or niche bloggers who are more accessible and looking for fresh stories. They also encourage businesses to give customers a small, free taste of their product to entice them to come back for more. This **"drug dealer" approach** has proven successful for many industries.

### The Myth of Overnight Success

The authors debunk the myth of overnight success and urge entrepreneurs to embrace slow, measured growth. Great brands like Starbucks, Apple, and Nike became successful over time without relying on big PR campaigns. 

---

**The key to effective promotion strategies is to focus on building an audience, providing value, and establishing a genuine connection with customers. Businesses should be creative, authentic, and proactive in their promotional efforts.**

## 10 | Hiring

### Unconventional Wisdom in Hiring

The book "Rework" by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson offers fresh perspectives on running a business, specifically in hiring. They advocate for **doing the job yourself** before hiring someone else, allowing you to grasp the work, write a realistic job description, and manage effectively. They caution against hiring for pleasure or creating unnecessary positions, emphasizing that **hiring should be based on a genuine need** and not on the overrated factors of years of experience and formal education. 

### The Art of Identifying Talent

The authors advise against relying on resumes which often contain exaggerated and meaningless information, suggesting **cover letters as a better indicator of a candidate's skills and alignment with company values**. They propose hiring individuals who exhibit dedication, personality, and intelligence, and who are willing to do the work themselves. 

### The Value of Independent Workers and Great Writers

The authors favor hiring "managers of one", individuals who can set their own goals and execute them without constant supervision. They also highlight the importance of **hiring great writers**, as clear writing signals clear thinking and effective communication skills.

### Embracing Remote Work

The authors stress the benefits of hiring the best talent regardless of their location, thanks to modern technology. They recommend having a few hours of real-time overlap for effective remote communication and occasional in-person meetings for personal connections.

### The Power of Test-Drives

They suggest **test-driving potential employees** before making a hiring decision, as interviews can only reveal so much. Hiring for a mini-project or simulation allows employers to observe a candidate's decision-making process, work ethic, and team fit.

---
**The key takeaway: Be unconventional in your hiring approach, as it offers a more accurate assessment of a candidate's fit and potential, leading to better hires and ultimately, a more successful business.**

## 11 | Damage Control

### Embrace the Power of Honesty in Crisis

In moments of crisis, remember that honesty is key. *Own up* to the issue and be the first to tell the story. Avoid the temptation to hide or downplay the problem, as this can lead to the spread of false information and rumors. Take a lesson from Exxon's PR mishap in 1989 and instead, aim to be like Ashland Oil's chairman who quickly turned a negative narrative into a positive one.

### The Art of Effective Apologies

**Apologizing** is a skill that should not be underestimated. A sincere and effective apology accepts responsibility, provides details about what happened, and most importantly, outlines steps to prevent the problem from recurring. Avoid using non-apology language and not acknowledging the severity of the situation. While there may not be a one-size-fits-all apology, it's crucial to empathize with your customer's feelings.

### Speedy Customer Service for the Win

Speed is crucial in customer service. A quick and personal response has the potential to turn a bad situation into a good one. In a world where delayed responses are expected, **a prompt reply can make a huge difference**.

### Connect Your Team to Your Customers

Ensure that everyone in your team is connected to your customers. This direct connection helps in understanding the product's strengths and weaknesses better. It also prevents the distortion or loss of messages from the customers. Make time for your team to interact with customers and don't shield them from any direct criticism.

### Handling Negative Reactions to Change

When change is introduced, negative reactions are inevitable. People are creatures of habit and naturally resist change. However, it's important to ride out these initial negative responses and give the changes a fair chance. Let the complaints simmer for a while and observe if people adjust and eventually come to like the change.

---

**In essence, honesty, promptness in customer service, effective apologies, direct team-customer interactions, and resilience in the face of negative reactions are key to successfully managing crisis situations and fostering growth.**

## 12 | Culture

### Embracing Authentic Culture

Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson argue in their book "Rework" that an authentic company culture cannot be concocted through mission statements or rules. It emerges from **consistent behavior**, such as promoting sharing, trust, and good customer service. Forcing a culture is a no-go, it should be allowed to develop naturally.

### Present Over Future

They warn against decisions based on hypothetical future problems. Their advice? **Decide for the present**, and adapt if circumstances change. Small businesses, with their agility to make swift changes, should focus on optimizing for the present instead of worrying about scalability.

### Beyond Rock Star Employees

The authors criticize the quest for "rock star" employees. They assert that the work environment establishes a **greater impact on performance** than individual abilities. Hence, companies should focus on creating an environment that fosters great work, providing trust, autonomy, and the necessary tools to succeed.

### Treating Employees like Adults

Micromanaging and creating a culture of nonthinkers is a pitfall. The authors believe that employees should be trusted to make their own decisions and manage their time. A boss-versus-worker relationship undermines trust. They also emphasize that employees, who manage commitments outside work, are often more efficient and productive.

### Against Unnecessary Policies

The authors argue that policies often become overreactions to isolated incidents, leading to bureaucratic organizations. Instead, companies should **address specific issues directly with individuals**.

### Honest Communication

Critiquing the use of formal and impersonal language in business communication, the authors advocate for **simple, direct, and honest communication**. They advise avoiding jargon and buzzwords, and promoting natural, conversational communication.

### The Power of Words

Certain words, such as "need," "must," "can't," "easy," "just," "only," and "fast" can stir tension and conflict. The authors suggest using alternative language that promotes healthy communication and avoids absolutes. They also caution against using "ASAP" for every request, as it devalues the urgency of true emergencies and creates unnecessary stress.

---

**Ultimately, nurturing a genuine culture, making adaptative decisions, fostering a supportive work environment, treating employees as adults, addressing issues directly, communicating honestly, and using appropriate language are the keys to successful business operations.**

## 13 | Conclusion

### Seize Your Inspiration

The finale of "Rework" brings attention to the fleeting quality of **inspiration**. In contrast to ideas, which live eternally, inspiration has a best-before date. To act on an idea, it's a must to **seize the moment**. When inspiration strikes, plunge into the task and exploit this drive to the fullest. 

### The Power of Now

Inspiration is a potent resource, but it won't linger for your convenience. 

### A Word of Gratitude

Lastly, the authors convey their gratitude to their readers, inviting them to share their experiences on how they've **reimagined their work strategy**.

---

**The key takeaway: Harness your inspiration in the now, as it's a potent but perishable resource.**
