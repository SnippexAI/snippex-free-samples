# The Healing Code: 6 minutes to heal the source of your health, success or relationship issue by Alex Loyd, Ben Johnson

## Preface - The Discovery that Changed Everything

### The Power of Healing Codes

The author begins by sharing his personal experience of **struggling with depression** and his wife Tracey's battle with clinical depression. In his quest for a solution, he discovered a method called "The Healing Codes". Through this system, Tracey's depression was eliminated in just 45 minutes, and with daily practice, she was permanently healed within three weeks. 

### Healing Beyond Depression

The author shares his excitement about integrating The Healing Codes into his practice, witnessing positive results in his clients. The healing extended beyond depression and anxiety, to more serious mental and emotional issues. One client even reported no longer having multiple sclerosis after practicing The Healing Codes for six weeks. The author acknowledges that these stories may sound sensational, but his conviction in the effectiveness of The Healing Codes is based on personal experiences and testimonials.

### Validity in Spirituality

Before spreading The Healing Codes, the author needed to validate its compatibility with his spiritual beliefs. After reflection, he concluded that The Healing Codes align with the teachings of the Bible and the way God created the universe and our bodies. 

### Redefining Medicine

The author shares his own experience with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. After researching **The Healing Codes as a potential treatment**, his symptoms disappeared, and he was symptom-free. He believes that The Healing Codes have the potential to revolutionize medicine by addressing the emotional and spiritual aspects of disease.

### The Human Body as a Computer Model

The author compares the human body to a computer model, explaining that we are created with certain programs, including a "self-healing" program. He suggests that if we could uncorrupt these files, the body's innate ability to heal itself would be restored.

### The Next Step in Healing Paradigm

The author believes that The Healing Codes is the most effective method for addressing and healing emotional and physical issues. He emphasizes that The Healing Codes is philosophically and scientifically sound, and it has worked for him personally. He dismisses criticisms related to the placebo effect, explaining that the fastest and most dramatic healing occurred in animals and infants, who cannot be influenced by the placebo effect.

---

**The Healing Codes represent a bold leap into the next step in the healing paradigm, providing a powerful tool for addressing and healing emotional and physical issues.**

## Foundations \(Do Not Skip This\!\)

### Unleashing the Power Within: The Immune System

Your body already possesses the greatest defense mechanism: the **immune system**. Picture it as your body's in-built 'defrag' program, capable of detecting and fixing problems before they escalate. All healing, regardless of the health issue, is primarily facilitated by this system.

### The Hidden Enemy: Stress

**Stress** can sabotage your health by deactivating your immune system. It's not just circumstantial stress; the real culprit is the deep-seated stress that resides within you, independent of your current circumstances. According to research, stress accounts for at least 95% of illnesses and diseases.

### The Ultimate Solution: Healing Heart Issues

The Healing Code is a transformative method that reinstates your body's healing capabilities by addressing deep-seated **heart issues**. It doesn't treat health problems directly; instead, it targets the source of all problems. Activating the Healing Code system eradicates physiological stress, rebooting your immune and healing systems. 

### Understanding Before Practicing

Before jumping into using The Healing Code, it's crucial to understand the theory behind it - **The Seven Secrets**. This part of the book provides a comprehensive understanding of health issues and their roots, paving the way for effective application of The Healing Code. 

### Focusing on Results

Part Two is all about results. It guides you on how to start healing the source of your problems and deal with both conscious and unconscious stress. The information shared is based on extensive research and personal experiences, promising significant healing. 

### The Spiritual Connection

The Healing Code is powerful, but the ultimate healing requires a spiritual connection with the **One who created the human body and energy**. This book doesn't aim to dictate beliefs but hopes to guide you towards understanding the One who holds the power to heal.

---

**The Healing Code is your body's key to unlock the healing power within, targeting the root causes of problems rather than symptoms, and fostering a deeper spiritual connection for ultimate healing.**

## 01 | Secret \#1 - There Is One Source of Illness and Disease

### The Secret of Health and Prosperity

The first secret to life, health, and prosperity is understanding that there is **one source of illness and disease**, and that is stress. Stress has been recognized by experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and Dr. Bruce Lipton, as the cause of over 90% of illness and disease. It's crucial to comprehend that stress is when the nervous system is out of balance, causing damage to our cells and organs, directly affecting our immune system.

### The Stress Barrel Concept

Doris Rapp, MD introduced the "stress barrel" concept, signifying the amount of stress we can handle before our weakest link breaks and we start experiencing symptoms. This is controlled in the central nervous system through the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (H-P-A). Stress can be measured through Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which reflects the balance in the autonomic nervous system.

### The Healing Code: A Solution to Stress

The Healing Code is a method that can consistently change and measure this balance. It aims to heal the source of stress, bringing the autonomic nervous system back into balance. Individuals who have used The Healing Code have reported shifting from being out of balance to being in balance in just 20 minutes or less.

### The Healing Code: Testimonials and Results

The success of The Healing Code is evident in the results reported by clients. At a conference, 142 people who used The Healing Code reported that their physical or non-physical issues had disappeared within a few minutes. The Healing Code has been described as a miracle by many people who have experienced dramatic physical healing from using it.

---

**The key takeaway is that the first secret to life, health, and prosperity is recognizing that stress is the root cause of illness and disease. The Healing Code is a powerful tool that can effectively address and eliminate this stress, leading to improved health and wellbeing.**

## 02 | Secret \#2 - Stress Is Caused by an Energy Problem in the Body

### Embrace the Energy Paradigm

The crux of life, health, and prosperity lies in understanding that stress is caused by an **energy problem in the body**. We live in a universe governed by the equation E=mc2, where every physical entity is a manifestation of energy. Disturbances in the energy frequencies within our bodies lead to health problems. 

### Quantum Physics: The Mystical Decoded

Quantum physics, a complex yet revolutionary branch of science, has greatly contributed to our understanding of energy. It postulates that all matter, including our bodies, is essentially energy, and everything has a frequency, wavelength, and color spectrum. Experiments have even indicated that information can be transferred at an unconscious level, even when individuals are physically separated. What was once considered mystical can now be explained by the principles of quantum physics.

### Energy In Medicine: A Game Changer

The medical industry has been slow to adopt this energy perspective. However, energy frequencies have been effective in various medical applications, such as breaking up kidney stones and stimulating healing in damaged skin. **Using frequency in medicine has the potential to revolutionize the industry** and empower individuals to heal themselves.

### The Healing Code: A Quantum Solution

The Healing Code, a method of intervention, works by changing destructive energy frequencies in the body into healthy ones. It uses the body's own healthy energy frequencies to neutralize the frequency causing the problem. This remarkable method has helped many overcome diseases, including cancer, by addressing the energy problem at its core.

### Testimonials: The Living Proof

Numerous testimonials of individuals who have experienced healing through The Healing Codes stand as proof of their effectiveness. They have healed a wide range of issues, from physical ailments like chronic fatigue syndrome and cancer to emotional problems like depression and panic attacks. The Healing Codes challenge the belief that genetics solely determine our health and offer a **powerful alternative to traditional medical treatments**.

---

**The most important takeaway is that every health problem is essentially an energy problem. By addressing these energy problems through methods like The Healing Codes, we can revolutionize healthcare and empower individuals to heal themselves.**

## 03 | Secret \#3 - The Issues of the Heart Are The Healing Control Mechanism

### The Power of the Heart in Healing

The third secret to life, health, and prosperity is that **the heart's issues are the healing control mechanism**. Stress, cellular memory, and unresolved emotional issues can lead to physical illness. A case that profoundly impacted me was a patient who had successfully treated her breast cancer but passed away due to unresolved emotional distress. 

### The Healing Codes and Cellular Memories

I was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease and desperately needed a solution. That's when I discovered The Healing Codes. Within six weeks of initiating this program, my symptoms had all resolved. The Healing Codes focus on healing cellular memories, which are memories stored in all of our cells. Research from various medical schools suggests that **cellular memories may be the key to healing incurable illnesses and diseases**. 

### Emotional Impact on Physical Health

Our memories play a crucial role in our overall health. The idea that memories affect our health has been recognized in psychology for a long time, and it was scientifically validated after World War I when soldiers returned with wounds despite not being physically injured. We all have memories filled with negative emotions such as anger, sadness, fear, guilt, and more. It doesn't make sense to have all of these negative emotions inside us without it affecting our health, relationships, and career.

### Healing vs Coping

When it comes to healing, it is important to address the destructive cellular memories. Coping with the memories is not the same as healing them. The Healing Code is a physical mechanism in the body that changes the energy pattern of the destructive cellular memory, turning off the stress response. It doesn't train us to think differently about our problems or balance brain chemicals. **Coping mechanisms, on the other hand, only help us deal with the pain temporarily**. They do not address the source of the problem and can actually prolong our suffering. 

---

**In conclusion, the third secret to life, health, and prosperity is that the heart's issues are the healing control mechanism. Healing the destructive cellular memories is essential for long-term health and overall well-being. Coping with memories is not the same as healing them, and true healing involves addressing the source of the problem.**

## 04 | Secret \#4 - The Human Hard Drive

### Unleashing the Power of Cellular Memories 

Our brains, akin to a computer's hard drive, store all our memories. Over **90% of these memories are subconscious** and are encoded as energy patterns in our cells. These memories, potent and often elusive, significantly impact our lives. 

### The Curse of Negative Memories

Negative beliefs embedded in our cellular memories activate our body's stress response, leading to problems. Our unconscious mind can re-activate these negative memories without our conscious control. This can cause unexplained negative emotions and behaviors. 

### The Healing Code: A Revolutionary Solution

The Healing Code is a method to heal these cellular memories and their destructive energy patterns. It's a way to *defrag our human hard drive* without the need for traditional therapeutic methods. It heals the destructive frequencies in our cellular memories, allowing us to embrace the truth and discard fear and negative beliefs. 

### Embracing Simplicity and Effectiveness 

The Healing Code exercises are simple, taking only about 6 minutes to complete. They can be done anywhere, making them easily incorporated into our daily lives. Despite the simplicity, the method's effectiveness may be hard to convince people of. 

### The Profound Impact of the Healing Code 

Examples of its effectiveness include a teenager who cured his flu symptoms and a seven-year-old girl who has been using The Healing Codes independently. 

---

**The Healing Code allows us to defrag our human hard drive, heal cellular memories and transform our lives, proving that simplicity does not compromise effectiveness.**

## 05 | Secret \#5 - Your Antivirus Program May Be Making You Sick

### Unleashing the Power Within

Just like a computer has an antivirus program to protect it from harm, we humans have a **similar program in our hearts and minds**. It's designed to shield us from both physical and emotional harm and develops as we accumulate negative experiences. It's essentially a stimulus/response mechanism, where we seek pleasure and avoid pain.

### The Three Types of Memories

There are **three types of memories** that can influence our responses: **inherited memories, pre-language and pre-logical-thinking memories, and trauma memories**. These memories can be activated inadvertently, resulting in unwanted thoughts, behaviors, and even physiological stress. 

*Inherited memories* are cellular memories that we inherit from our parents. They are encoded into the DNA of our cells and can be passed down through generations. *Pre-language and pre-logical-thinking memories* are memories that are recorded before we were able to think rationally or talk well. *Trauma memories* are encoded when a trauma occurs, and they can also be inherited.

### The Impact of Trauma Memories

Trauma memories can become part of a **protective programming belief system** that prioritizes pain memories and diminishes logical thinking. These trauma memories are not in the past for our hearts. They are experienced as emergencies happening in the present moment, leading to confusion and conflict. 

### Healing the Unconscious Mind

Our unconscious mind, acting as an antivirus program, may be making us sick by resisting healing these trauma memories. Traditional therapy methods often fall short as they fail to address the unconscious mind effectively. However, **The Healing Codes**, a revolutionary method, has shown promising results in healing these memories and addressing the source of our issues. 

---

**The key takeaway from this is that the Healing Codes can effectively heal trauma memories and address the source of our issues, leading us to a healthier and more prosperous life.**

## 06 | Secret \#6 - I Believe\!

### The Power of Belief

In the journey to life success, the sixth secret is **belief**. Our beliefs, whether conscious or unconscious, are formed early and shape our actions, behaviors, and outcomes. Just like the young boy in China who broke bricks with his bare hands, we too can topple the bricks in our lives when we truly *believe* we can. 

### Relationship Dynamics and Belief 

Our beliefs also play a pivotal role in our relationships. They form the foundation of shared values in a marriage, but also bear the potential to cause problems. A staggering *90% of our beliefs are unconscious*, and these can override our conscious beliefs, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts. 

### Belief and Habits

Beliefs are strongly tied to our habits. By healing destructive heart memories through The Healing Codes, we can change our negative associations and habits, making way for positive change. 

### The Impact of Belief on Performance 

Belief is a performance enhancer. Whether in sports or life, players who believe they will succeed are more likely to embrace crucial moments. **Our beliefs shape our actions and outcomes** in myriad aspects of life. 

### Belief and Health 

Our beliefs even have the power to alter our physical health. Research from Stanford University Medical School suggests that incorrect beliefs can trigger illness, whilst believing the truth can fortify our cells against disease. 

---

**In essence, belief is a transformative force that influences our lives, health, and prosperity. By addressing and healing our destructive beliefs, we can overcome obstacles, improve relationships, achieve peak performance, and live a life in harmony with our true desires.**


## 07 | Secret \#7 - When the Heart and the Head Conflict, the Winner Is...

### The Power of the Unconscious Mind
The author conducts a fascinating experiment during his lectures, making a volunteer imagine a key moving on a divided circle. Surprisingly, the key starts to move in the predicted direction 75-80% of the time. This phenomenon is caused by what the author calls the **"heart command"** - the unconscious mind - overriding the head command, which is the conscious mind. Even when not in distress, our heart commands take precedence, leading to actions and thoughts we might not consciously desire.

### The Heart-Head Battle and Its Implications
The heart communicates through images and imagination, activating neurons in our brain and sending impulses to our fingers. This explains why even if we consciously believe certain things, we might still act differently due to unconscious pain memories. The heart command, based on these memories, overrides conscious beliefs and influences our behavior. About 20-25% of people, who have more unconscious pain memories, are unable to imagine the key moving. These memories still affect their thoughts, feelings, and actions.

### Healing the Heart for Complete Healing
A verse from the Bible states that the issues of life originate from the heart. The author suggests that if there is an issue in life, it is a heart issue that needs to be healed. Healing the heart issue is essential for permanent and complete healing. Quantum physicist Professor William Tiller and Dr. Bruce Lipton also support this idea, emphasizing the power of the unconscious mind over conscious intention. 

### The Healing Code: A Solution for Heart Issues
The author introduces the Healing Code, a tool that not only activates physical mechanisms in the body but also addresses the destructive energy patterns of memories, healing heart issues. The Bible and science align in the understanding that all issues in life originate from the heart.

### The Impact of Heart Issues on Our Lives
Heart issues determine who we are and influence our beliefs and actions. Our current circumstances are often influenced by past pain memories stored in our hearts. These memories can cause us to act in ways that are not aligned with our conscious desires. Our priorities are determined by what is in our hearts, and our rational thinking can be influenced by unconscious fear-based beliefs. 

### The Healing Code: Proven Effectiveness
The author shares multiple stories of individuals who have experienced significant improvements in their physical and mental health after using the Healing Code. These cases suggest that the Healing Code could be the future of medicine, healing not only physical health but also relationship problems, mental health issues, career problems, and peak performance issues.

---

**The takeaway from the text is that the unconscious mind or "heart command" has a significant influence on our actions, thoughts, and feelings, often overriding our conscious beliefs. Healing the heart and addressing these unconscious pain memories is essential for achieving long-term success and well-being. The Healing Code offers a promising solution for these heart issues.**

## 08 | It's All about Results

### The Power of Results and the Heart

The author starts by stressing the significance of **results**. It's not about what you wish, think, or hope for; it's about what you can *achieve*. More importantly, it's about tapping into the heart to find solutions. The heart, being the center of everything that we are, gives us the power to make things happen.

### Storyboarding Your Desires

Storyboarding, a concept developed by Walt Disney, is introduced as a **powerful tool** for visualizing and achieving your desires. Write down your desires without limitations, and evaluate them based on truth and love. Remember, everyone's truth and love can look different, but it's crucial to seek them in order to gain clarity of purpose.

### The Power of Belief and Affirmations

Beliefs have a **tremendous influence** on the results we get in life. They can be as powerful as the placebo and nocebo effects. Always remember, *believing releases power for results*. However, affirmations alone are not enough. Instead, use "truth focus statements" - positive statements that you truly believe in.

### Understanding Your Beliefs

Every action we take is based on what we believe. If you find yourself engaging in unwanted behavior, it's because of a wrong belief. It's crucial to understand that sustained power and results come from **believing the whole truth**.

### The Power of Belief in Changing Reality 

Believing the truth in love about our lives can lead to positive results in health, prosperity, relationships, and overall well-being. But confusion can block the truth. To combat this, the author introduces the concept of the peace test, which helps determine if we are believing the truth.

### The Importance of Understanding

Understanding is the **missing ingredient** in achieving sustained results. Despite having access to more truth than ever, society is getting sicker. This is due to the bombardment of negative images and messages. To believe the truth, we need to understand it. Healing the lies in our hearts allows us to understand the truth and experience sustained results.

### The Healing Codes: A Tool for Healing 

The Healing Codes are introduced as a tool that can heal the source of the problem rather than just addressing symptoms. They work in conjunction with prayer and are not a replacement for it. 

### Five Steps to Desired Results 

The author concludes with five steps to getting the desired results: Results, Power, Belief, Understanding, and Truth. If applied, these steps will lead to the desired results. 

---

**The key to achieving the results you seek lies in understanding the truth and believing in it wholeheartedly.**

## 09 | What Is a Healing Code?

### **Embrace the Power of Healing**

We are all bound by limitations, often left feeling hopeless after numerous self-help attempts that barely scratch the surface of our deep-rooted issues. As a life coach, I've found that most people know what they need to change, but lack the tools to do so. This is where **The Healing Codes** come into play.

### **Journey to Transformation**

The Healing Codes provide an opportunity to heal both physical and nonphysical issues. They activate the body's natural healing mechanisms, not through miracles, but by removing stress at its source and calling upon our internal healing resource. 

### **The Mechanism of Healing Codes**

This approach involves directing healing energy to four healing centers on the body, using specific hand positions. The effectiveness of The Healing Codes is supported by client testimonials and diagnostic tests showing stress removal from the body.

### **Harnessing the Frequency of Love**

The Healing Codes work by tapping into the energy frequency of pure love, believed to have the power to heal anything. They change destructive memories into healthy ones and infuse healing frequencies into the guarded memories causing issues.

### **Restrictions and Recommendations**

While The Healing Codes have shown promising results, they are not intended to replace professional health advice. They should be used for relaxation, stress reduction, and bio-energetic balancing, always in consultation with appropriate health professionals.

---

**The Healing Codes are a transformative tool that can help individuals overcome limitations and excel in their lives, by healing the spiritual issues of the heart, reducing physiological stress, and improving immune system functioning.**

## 10 | Your 6-Minute "Universal Healing Code"

### Mastering the Universal Healing Code

Having discovered the Healing Codes® in 2001, the author presents us with a unique technique, the **Universal Healing Code**. This technique activates all four healing centers and acts as a master code for stress relief. This code can be learned in minutes, but the results can last a lifetime. 

The code incorporates prayer, which has been proven beneficial in healing. The author emphasizes on this, suggesting making prayer the primary focus, using the Healing Code as a part of the process. 

### The Execution of the Healing Code

The author provides detailed instructions for performing the code. The code should be done in a quiet and private place free from distractions. The sequence involves rating the issue on a scale of 0 to 10, identifying feelings and beliefs related to the issue, finding an earlier memory with a similar feeling, saying a prayer for healing, and doing the Healing Code while focusing on a positive statement. 

### The Healing Process and Its Implications

The author further explains that the Healing Code can be done on behalf of someone else by saying a prayer for their healing and then doing the code on oneself. Consistency is key to getting the best results. Healing times vary from person to person and depend on the specific issues being addressed.

### Understanding the Healing Response

The author advises that feeling worse after completing the Code is a normal healing response, which indicates that the body is healing and toxins and negative emotions are being released. The author advises drinking plenty of water to aid in the detoxification process. 

### The Healing Code and Conscious Conflict

The author addresses the phenomenon of conscious conflict, which occurs when something in a person's life violates their belief system but they are not ready to let go of it. They suggest that conscious conflict can hinder healing and should be addressed as a priority. 

### Closing Thoughts on the Healing Code

In conclusion, the author emphasizes the power of the healing code in addressing various aspects of life. Despite the varying healing times and sometimes uncomfortable healing responses, the author assures us that **the Healing Code is always working, even if changes are not immediately felt or happening as quickly as desired**.

---

**The Universal Healing Code offers a powerful tool for addressing various life issues. Its effectiveness, when practiced consistently and mindfully, can bring about lasting positive changes in one’s life.**
