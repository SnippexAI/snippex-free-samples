# Becoming Supernatural: How Common People Are Doing the Uncommon by Dr. Joe Dispenza

## Introduction: Getting Ready to Become Supernatural

### An Invitation to the Extraordinary

Greetings, dear readers. I am here to guide you through a journey of transformation, where you will not only read, but also embody, the essence of the extraordinary. This book, although it may not sit well with the skeptics, is a beacon of hope and possibility for those open to exploring the depths of human potential. 

Through my years of diligent research and experience, I have crafted a narrative that transcends the boundaries of traditional science and enters the realm of the supernatural, a realm where each of us are *dimensional beings living dimensional lives*. I invite you to embrace this perspective, for it harbors great potential for personal growth and collective change.

### The Symphony of Coherence

At the core of this narrative is the concept of *coherence*. Through practices such as meditation, we can synchronize our brains and hearts, creating harmony within ourselves. This harmony, in turn, influences our biology, our reality, and even the hearts of others. By opening ourselves to these elevated emotions, we can transform self-limiting behaviors, beliefs, and habits into ones that serve our higher purpose.

### The Power of Collective Transformation

I am thrilled to introduce you to *Project Coherence*, a grand experiment where thousands of people come together to uplift the frequency of our planet and its inhabitants. By raising our energy in unison, we create a collective heart and brain coherence that can contribute to global change. Our collective efforts, as reflected in the significant energy shifts observed during our workshops, bring forth the evidence of our shared power.

### Harnessing Vital Energy

Further, I explore the concept of the invisible field of vital energy that surrounds us. This energy, which can be increased or diminished, is quantifiable through the emission of photons. More light emission indicates more energy and life, providing a tangible measure of our internal vitality. 

### The Blueprint of Transformation

The journey I lay out for you is not a straight path, but a winding road of self-discovery and growth. It includes stories that illustrate the potential of becoming supernatural, insights into the importance of being present, an introduction to the quantum world, and a range of meditations and practices to help you harness your full potential. 

### Conclusion

In essence, this book is an invitation to become supernatural, to tap into your inherent potential, and to contribute to changing the world. It is an invitation to embrace the extraordinary. By the end of this journey, you will not only understand but also experience the profound transformation that awaits you. So, let's step into the realm of the extraordinary together, one page at a time.

## 01 | Opening the Door to the Supernatural

### The Intersection of Body and Mind: Anna's Tale

In the bustling city of Amsterdam, we encounter the tale of Anna Willems, a once vibrant psychotherapist turned survivor of life's most distressing tribulations. Anna's life took a sudden turn with the tragic suicide of her husband, which sent her spiralling into an unending loop of stress and trauma. The emotional shockwave of this event triggered a physiological survival response, handcuffing her body to a relentless state of emergency. In this state, she was trapped in a cycle of *reliving her trauma*, thus reinforcing her suffering and blocking her path to healing.

This emotional turmoil waged a war on her physical health, leading to a convoluted mix of psychological, emotional and financial stress. The culmination was a diagnosis of neuritis, an affliction of her peripheral nervous system induced by an autoimmune condition. This left Anna in a state of paralysis from the waist down, further adding to her list of woes.

### The Power of Mind Over Matter

Anna's physical and emotional decline was a by-product of her mental state, a testament to the *powerful link between mind and body*. Her thoughts and emotions were shackled to her past, hindering her healing and progression. As her health continued to deteriorate, she reached a breaking point and decided to change her course. She began meditating twice a day and attending workshops on the power of thoughts and emotions. 

Through a combination of different meditation techniques, she realized that her negative thoughts were programming her genes to create poor health conditions. She learned to shift her focus from past to future, *realigning her genetic expression* with her desired future state. Over time, she noticed improvements in her mental and emotional well-being, which eventually mirrored in her physical health.

### Becoming Supernatural: Anna's Transformation

Anna's journey was a testament to the mystic power of becoming supernatural and the profound impact of self-awareness. By harnessing the power of her mind, she was *able to heal from her past traumas* and transform her life, becoming a beacon of hope and inspiration for others. Her past health problems, once a source of suffering, became the catalyst for her transformation.

### A Mystical Journey into the Self

Our narrative takes a mystical turn as it ventures into the realm of self-awareness and interconnectedness. The author shares a personal account of a trance-like state, where they witness their past and future selves simultaneously. This transcendent experience led to an understanding of the *multidimensionality of existence* and the power of the present moment in shaping our futures.

### A Glimpse into a Past Life

In a profound meditation session, the author experiences a past life regression, living as a philosopher in ancient times, promoting personal freedom and empowerment. Despite facing persecution and torture, the philosopher remains steadfast in their mission. This past life experience underscores the *power of conviction* and the potential of our present actions in shaping our future realities.

### The Power of the Present 

This narrative affirms the idea of our *multidimensional existence* and the transformative power of the present moment. By consciously shaping our thoughts, actions, and emotions in the present, we can indeed influence our future, and in doing so, we become the architects of our own destiny.

## 02 | The Present Moment

### The Dance of the Present Moment

We begin our journey with the understanding that to truly tap into the supernatural, to heal our bodies, and to create new opportunities, one must first understand and embrace the concept of the _present moment_. Existing in the present goes beyond merely navigating the physical world. It is an art of transcending time and personal identity, surrendering to the cosmic rhythm, and allowing a greater force to take the reins. It is this surrender that paves the way to a new life and a new destiny.

### The Loom of the Mind

The author delves into the intricacies of how the brain functions, painting a vivid picture of the mind as a loom. The neurological tissue in the brain or body, when activated, weaves the thread of the mind. Different tasks activate specific sequences of neural networks, clusters of neurons that collaborate to create the tapestry of our thoughts and memories. Like any skilled artisan, the more we practice, the stronger these connections become, weaving long-term memories into the fabric of our minds.

### The Emotion-Experience Connection

An essential aspect of this process is the role of emotions. Emotions are the vibrant colors that bring our mental tapestry to life. They are the chemical residue of past experiences, leaving lasting impressions on the cognitive fabric. When specific events stir strong emotional responses, memories are formed. The more an experience is repeated, the stronger the neural connections become, sustaining a long-term relationship.

### The Cycle of Past and Future

The author then uncovers how the past becomes the future. Thoughts and emotions are deeply interconnected, influencing each other in a perpetual dance. When a thought is accompanied by a certain emotion, it triggers the release of chemicals that make us continue to feel in a certain way. This creates a cycle where thinking creates feeling and feeling creates thinking. By repeatedly thinking the same thoughts and feeling the same emotions, we hardwire our brain into the same patterns, conditioning our body to the past.

### The Prison of Habit

Daily routines can easily become habits, which are automatic, unconscious thoughts, behaviors, and emotions acquired through repetition. When these routines are enacted over and over again, the body goes on autopilot, performing the same actions without conscious thought. This predictability constrains the future to a copy of the past.

### Breaking Free from the Past

The author concludes by stating that if we retain the same routine as yesterday, our future will be a replica of our past. The future becomes a rerun of the past, with the mind and body stuck in the known, the predictable future based on the familiar past. Any disruption to the routine is viewed as troublesome. The author emphasizes the importance of _being present_ and transcending the past to create a new future.

### The Power of Mental Rehearsal

The human mind possesses immense power. By mentally rehearsing specific thoughts and feelings, we can change our brain and body without the need for physical experience. Studies have shown that mental rehearsal primes our brains for experience, making it easier to perform in the future. By focusing our attention on the present moment and redirecting our energy towards the unknown, we can break free from the repetitive patterns of the past, opening ourselves to new possibilities.

### Emotions and Genetic Expression

Our emotions can affect our genes. Emotions are chemical feedback that can signal genes to either turn on or turn off, affecting the expression of proteins in the body. By changing emotions, one can change the expression of genes and instruct them to make different proteins, which can then change the structure and function of the body. However, living by the same emotions day in and day out keeps the body locked into the old state of being. In order to make lasting changes, one must think greater than the way they feel.

### The Power of Elevated Emotions

Elevated emotions such as love, joy, inspiration, or gratitude have been shown to strengthen our immune system. By practicing maintaining these elevated emotions and changing our energy, we can up-regulate new genes that produce healthy proteins to strengthen our internal defense system. This means that we have the power to heal ourselves from within without the need for external substances. Simply spending a few minutes a day in an elevated state can have significant positive effects on our health and body.

### The Energetic Bonds of Experience

Our external environment begins to control our thoughts and feelings, limiting our ability to create a new destiny. When we react to threatening conditions in our outer world, our body releases stress hormones to mobilize energy. This response is adaptive in dangerous situations, but in modern times, it becomes chronic and maladaptive. Living in survival mode keeps us in a state of heightened arousal, leading to imbalances and down-regulation of healthy gene expression. Our bodies become addicted to stress hormones, craving them and causing our brains to be overly alert and aroused.

### Breaking Free from Energetic Bonds

We create energetic bonds with the elements in our outer world, just like two atoms are bonded together by an invisible field of energy. When two people share the same emotions and energy, they also become bonded together. These bonds keep us connected to our past-present reality and prevent us from creating a new future. To break these bonds, we need to call our energy back to ourselves and take our attention off the external world. This requires us to let go of our attachments to people, things, and circumstances that are no longer serving us.

### The Power of Now

The author emphasizes the importance of being in the present moment during meditation. By overcoming automatic thinking, emotions, and habits, one can weaken the energetic bonds with their past-present reality and find themselves in the present moment. Being in the present moment is crucial for creating a new future where stress, problems, and pain don't exist. By continuously calling their energy back to them and breaking the energetic bonds with their familiar known reality, one can create something new.

### Conclusion

The author concludes by discussing the process of breaking the bonds with one's past-present reality and building their own personal energy field. They reflect on the importance of being present in the moment and not getting caught up in thoughts of the past or future. Ultimately, being present in the moment allows for the creation of new possibilities in life.

## 03 | Tuning In to New Potentials in the Quantum

### A Dance with the Quantum Field

Imagine the universe not as a constellation of stars and galaxies, but as an *invisible field of energy and information* that transcends space and time. This, dear friends, is the *quantum field* or the *unified field*, a realm of infinite possibilities that governs all laws of nature. It's a realm where chaos gives birth to order, where the Big Bang's tumultuous beginnings morph into the harmonious dance of universes and galaxies. It's a realm devoid of physicality, yet brimming with energy and frequency, a vast black space radiating infinite amounts of energy that vibrates beyond our physical world. 

### The Power of Consciousness

As we enter this realm, we exist not as physical beings but as *awareness* or *consciousness*. Bereft of our physical senses, we experience the field through our awareness. Our consciousness becomes a conduit, connecting us to greater levels of frequency and information. Imagine it as an interconnected field of invisible waves of energy that exist beyond our senses. It's not an empty void, but a realm filled with energy and information. Here, *all possibilities exist*. Your consciousness, your awareness, collapses the wave function, transmuting energy into particles, into reality. When you stop observing, the particle reverts back to energy and possibility. 

### Embracing the Unknown

Yet, if we view our lives through the same lens every day, if we anticipate our future based on our past, we collapse this infinite field of energy into the same patterns. The key, then, is to *shift our attention from the physical world and enter the present moment*. This is how we tap into the field of infinite possibilities. By investing our energy into the unknown, staying in this field of infinite possibilities, we create new experiences, new possibilities in our lives. 

### A Symphony in the Brain

This journey into the quantum field as awareness, as consciousness, creates significant changes in our brains. The thinking brain slows down, it becomes less aroused, it starts working in a more holistic fashion. Your brain waves become more coherent and unified, leading to a more whole-brain state. Different neural communities synchronize, organize, and integrate, resulting in a more coherent and whole experience for you.

### Intention and Emotion: The Keys to Creation

To manifest potentials from the quantum field into reality, we need a clear intention and elevated emotion. A *clear intention* is a lucid vision of what we want to create, a detailed description of our desired reality. *Elevated emotions*, such as love, gratitude, and joy, help us tap into the feeling we anticipate when we manifest our intention. These heartfelt emotions contribute to your body's energy field, creating a measurable magnetic field. Combining the electric charge of intention with the magnetic charge of elevated emotion creates an electromagnetic signature that attracts experiences that match your energy. 

### The Power of Intention and Elevated Emotion

French researcher René Peoc’h demonstrated the power of intention using baby chicks. The chicks, imprinted on a robot, influenced the robot's movements with their intentions. This experiment illustrates the potential of *intention to shape reality*. 

### Tuning Into the Future

My son, Jace, created a new job for himself using a technique called *tuning into new potentials*. By priming his brain and body to believe that the future he wanted had already occurred, Jace manifested his new job.

### Being Present in the Quantum Field 

When we become no body, no one, no thing, no where, in no time, we are able to focus on the unified field of intelligence within and around us. By turning inward and being present with this consciousness, we can align ourselves with the infinite potentials of the quantum field. When we change our energy, *we change our lives*. 

### Becoming the Vortex to Your Future

By envisioning and mentally rehearsing the desired future, using elevated emotions to make it feel real, surrendering this creation to a higher power, blessing all aspects of life, and expressing gratitude, one can tap into new potentials in the quantum realm. The key is to slowly return to the present moment and act as if the desired future has already occurred, allowing synchronicities and new possibilities to come naturally.


## 04 | Blessing of the Energy Centers

### The Dance of Light and Consciousness

In the cosmic ballet, everything is composed of two inseparable partners: light and consciousness, or energy and information. This duet exists across a spectrum of frequencies, many of which are beyond the limits of human perception. Indeed, the visible light spectrum - the colors we perceive - is a fraction of the total, less than 1%. This understanding expands our reality, which is often limited to the physical plane. 

### The Communicative Nature of Cells 

At the microscopic level, cells converse, transmitting vital information through different frequencies of light. Just as radio waves carry signals, cells emit organized and coherent electromagnetic energy. If a cell fails to emit this energy adequately, it becomes unhealthy, challenging the traditional view of cells as mere charged molecules attracting or repelling each other. By realizing that we are beings of light, radiating life force and expressing a light field around our bodies, we can begin to understand the interconnectedness of life.

### The Power of Focus and Meditation

The text introduces the concepts of convergent and divergent focus. Convergent focus is a precise point of attention, while divergent focus refers to a broader awareness of the surrounding space. By practicing both types of focus, we can improve our brain coherence and overall well-being. However, stress tends to narrow our focus, disrupting the harmony of our thoughts and actions. Through meditation, we can tune into different frequencies of reality, accessing new levels of light and information that can influence our physical world and promote our health and well-being.

### Activating Energy Centers Through Focus

Our bodies house energy centers, each with its unique mind, glands, hormones, chemicals, and neuron clusters. By shifting our attention from a narrow to an open focus, we can activate these centers, bringing coherence to them and effecting real, physical change. This shift, from matter to energy, can be achieved through meditation, a technique that has been practiced in Buddhist tradition for millennia.

### The Evolution of Energy and Consciousness

As our energy evolves, it flows from the first to the eighth energy center, increasing in frequency with each step. However, when energy stagnates in certain centers, it hampers our evolution and can lead to physical and emotional issues. By activating each energy center, we stimulate the associated neurological plexuses and glands, emitting energy with specific information or intention. However, if we constantly draw from the lower energy centers and live in survival mode, our energy field shrinks, limiting our potential and leading to disease.

### The Blessing of Energy Centers

The Blessing of the Energy Centers meditation aims to speed up the frequency of these centers, bringing them back into coherence and order. By slowing down brain waves and accessing the subconscious mind, individuals can tap into their autonomic nervous system, which controls these centers. The practice involves planting a seed of intention and letting go, allowing the autonomic nervous system to create balance in the body. This meditation, popular among students, has produced exceptional results, fostering a sense of unlimited potential and promoting healing in a magnificent way.

## 05 | Reconditioning the Body to a New Mind

### Dancing with Breath: The Symphony of Life

In the grand orchestra of life, the breath is our maestro, conducting an intricate symphony that attunes us to a higher state of being. The art of proper breathing serves as a critical instrument in our journey to transcend the ordinary and enter the realm of the supernatural.

### The Thinking-Feeling Loop: A Spiral to the Past

Our minds are like well-worn paths, trodden by the ceaseless march of our thoughts and feelings. This *thinking-feeling loop*, as we shall call it, is a self-sustaining cycle, wherein our thoughts trigger biochemical reactions that unleash a cascade of emotions. Ironically, this loop that keeps us tethered to the past, making us prisoners of our own emotions, is born out of a mechanism designed for our survival.

### The Trifecta of Survival: The First Three Energy Centers

Our bodies are complex conduits of energy, with each energy center or *chakra* serving as a powerhouse of specific emotions and physiological functions. The first three centers, associated with primal survival instincts, often become overstimulated, draining our energy and leaving us locked in a state of perpetual survival mode. 

### The Power of Breath: Liberator of Trapped Energy

Our breath, a simple yet profound tool, holds the key to breaking free from this cycle. Like a skilled locksmith, the technique of controlled breathing can unlock the trapped energy in our lower centers, allowing it to rise and replenish our whole being. This process not only recharges our energy but also allows us to transmute our base emotions into higher states of consciousness like love, joy, and gratitude.

### The Body and Mind: A Magnetic Symphony

Just as a magnet has its poles, our body has its own polarity, with our mind and brain serving as the north pole and our survival centers as the south. Living in the perpetual survival mode drains our energy, reducing our body's electromagnetic field and disrupting the harmony of our existence.

### Cerebrospinal Fluid: The Life-Elixir

Our central nervous system, sheltered within our spine and skull, is the conductor of this intricate symphony of life. The cerebrospinal fluid within this system enhances electrical charges, creating a ripple effect that pumps this elixir up our spine, nourishing our brain and body.

### The Breath Technique: Harnessing Inner Power

Breathing techniques, specifically, retuning the breath, can be a transformative process, drawing stored energy from our lower centers back to the brain and creating a harmonious electromagnetic field around the body. This activation of energy produces gamma brain waves, leading to heightened awareness and consciousness.

### Embracing Elevated Emotions: The Genesis of Change

Our emotions, the end product of our experiences, can be powerful drivers of change. By embracing elevated emotions during meditation, we signal our genes ahead of the environment, preparing our body chemically for a future it believes is already here. This shift in frequency can help us move towards better health.

### Unlocking the Potentials: Activating Our "Junk" DNA

Our DNA is a treasure chest of potentials, waiting to be unlocked. Though we utilize only a minuscule fraction of our DNA, the rest, often dismissed as 'junk', may hold the key to untapped abilities and experiences.

### Reconditioning the Body: A Guided Meditation 

Through guided meditation, we can recondition the body to a new mind, activating our genes and unlocking our body's potential. By focusing on different parts of the body and cultivating elevated emotions, we can manifest a new life even before it has unfolded.

In summary, the dance of breath, the harmony of emotions, and the untapped potential within our DNA offer us a pathway to transcend the ordinary and embrace the extraordinary. As we master this symphony of life, we become more than just physical beings, we become energy, we become consciousness, we become *supernatural*.

## 06 | Case Studies: Living Examples of Truth

### The Power of Mind Over Body

The author invites us on a journey of discovery, through the lives of ordinary people who have used the power of their minds to overcome physical ailments. This exploration serves as a beacon of hope; a testament that anyone can rise above their limitations and transform their lives. 

### Ginny's Journey from Pain to Peace

Firstly, we meet Ginny, a woman crippled by chronic pain from a car accident. After attending a meditation workshop, she experienced a profound shift. She managed to confront her pain and anger, and felt energy leave her body, leading to a state of deep relaxation. Miraculously, Ginny was able to walk without pain, and has remained pain-free since.

### The Resurrection of Daniel

Our second hero is Daniel, a man suffering from electromagnetic hypersensitivity and chronic pain. Drawing strength from the book "You Are the Placebo", Daniel began meditating, which eventually led to his complete recovery. He reclaimed his life, demonstrating the transformative power of meditation.

### Jennifer's Victory Run

The story of Jennifer, who battled multiple illnesses, is equally inspiring. Encouraged by her partner, she undertook the meditative practices recommended in "You Are the Placebo", resulting in significant improvements in her health. Jennifer's journey is a testament to the power of perseverance and belief in healing oneself.

### Felicia's Fight for Freedom

Lastly, we encounter Felicia, a doctor with eczema and skin infections. Despite resistance from medical bodies, she adopted a holistic approach to her health. Meditating daily, she experienced a profound energy surge and a deep connection with a loving consciousness. Her skin improved dramatically, and she let go of her medication. Felicia's story illustrates that even medical professionals can benefit from the integration of Eastern philosophies into Western medical practices.

### Unleashing the Healing Potential

These remarkable stories are a testament to the power of the mind-body connection and the potential of meditation in healing. They show us that by tapping into our minds and connecting with a higher consciousness, we are capable of overcoming chronic pain, illness, and limitations. Our health and happiness lie in our hands, and these stories serve as a living proof of this profound truth.

## 07 | Heart Intelligence

### The Heart: Beyond a Mechanical Pump

The heart, often symbolized as a beacon of wisdom and intuition, has been historically considered a center of life. As the sands of time shifted, it became viewed as a mere mechanical pump during the scientific revolution of the 17th century. However, our understanding has evolved once again. Today, we recognize the heart as a source of electromagnetic fields and a conduit to a unified field, influencing our feelings, emotions, and understanding of ourselves and the world. 

### The Power of Heart Coherence 

The modern world, rife with stress, often disrupts our mental and emotional equilibrium, contributing to grave health issues such as heart disease. However, there is hope in the science of heart coherence. Through this, we can regulate our internal states, crafting a healthier future. The HeartMath Institute has been at the forefront of researching this powerful connection between the heart and brain. By fusing elevated emotions with intention, we can alter our biological energy and consequently, our lives. This combination yields tangible effects on matter, allowing us to shift from a past-focused existence to a future-oriented one.

### The Benefits of Heart Coherence 

Heart coherence boasts multiple benefits, from lowering blood pressure and improving the nervous system and hormonal balance, to enhancing brain function. By staying in elevated emotional states, we can tap into high-level intuition, better understand ourselves and others, prevent stressful patterns, enhance mental clarity, and make more informed decisions. Consistent heart-centered emotions also promote healthier gene expression.

### Cultivating Heart Coherence 

The journey to heart coherence begins with nurturing and sustaining elevated emotions such as gratitude, appreciation, inspiration, kindness, compassion, and joy. A coherent heart boosts the brain's energy, creativity, and intuition, fostering a sense of wholeness and connection. From this state, we can establish a new internal order and experience optimal health and happiness. The heart serves as a bridge to greater levels of awareness and energy. It is the place where polarized energy merges into one, where separation becomes unity.

### The Autonomic Nervous System 

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis within the body. It comprises the sympathetic nervous system, which stimulates the fight-or-flight response, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which conserves energy and relaxes the body. These systems continuously communicate between the heart and brain, contributing to our feelings of relaxation and safety when our body is in a state of homeostasis. By fostering coherence in the heart, we can improve brain function, and experience heightened creativity, focus, awareness, and openness to learning.

### The Dance of Coherence and Incoherence 

The text delves into the concept of heart intelligence and its relation to coherence and incoherence. When the heart beats incoherently, it can lead to feelings of imbalance, anxiety, and an unfocused state. This incoherence is often a result of stress, which disrupts the body's balance and can manifest in various stress-related symptoms. However, resilience, or the ability to adapt and recover from stress, is key to managing stress and maintaining health and homeostasis.

### The Heart-Brain Connection 

The heart and brain share a dynamic connection. The heart has its own independent nervous system, known as the "heart-brain," that influences higher cognitive and emotional centers. Emotions and feelings originating in the heart play a significant role in our thinking, processing of information, and understanding of the world. By cultivating heart-centered emotions such as gratitude, abundance, freedom, or love, we can lay the neural networks for future emotions or a new destiny.

### The Power of Sustaining Elevated Emotions 

By sustaining elevated emotions on a daily basis, the body begins to make genetic changes. When we open our heart center, feel an emotion before the experience occurs, and combine it with a clear intention, the body responds as if it is already in the future experience. This heart-mind coherence influences body chemistry and energy in various ways, leading to a heart-empowered individual who naturally chooses love and demonstrates compassion and care for oneself, others, and the planet.

### Harnessing Heart Intelligence 

Developing heart intelligence involves the practice of regulating heart rhythms to sustain elevated emotions. By repeatedly practicing the regulation of heightened emotional states, individuals can create a new emotional baseline that influences their thoughts and sustains the elevated feelings. This feedback loop between the heart and mind creates an entirely new state of being characterized by profound love and gratitude.

### The Journey to Coherence 

The author provides a heart coherence meditation technique as a practical tool to harness heart intelligence. By closing their eyes, relaxing their bodies, and focusing attention on the heart while evoking elevated emotions, individuals can practice heart coherence. This practice can be incorporated into daily life, promoting personal and collective evolution, and creating a vibrational influence of harmony and coherence. Through this transformative journey, we can alter the way we act with one another and create positive experiences that promote peace, harmony, and unity.

## 08 | Mind Movies/Kaleidoscope

### The Subconscious Power of Advertising

An intriguing phenomenon in our modern society is the power of advertising, a force that can be used to shape our beliefs and choices. A striking example of this power can be seen in pharmaceutical commercials. Intriguingly, these commercials aim to evoke strong emotional reactions, often through shocking imagery and fear-inducing narratives. They insinuate that diseases like shingles, an affliction most of us carry dormant within us, could suddenly awaken and wreak havoc on our lives. The commercials then suggest that their promoted drug could bolster our immune system and protect us from the impending danger. Yet, the commercials often subtly state that those with weakened immune systems—the very individuals the commercials initially targeted—should not use these drugs, creating a confusing and disorienting message.

*Just like a skilled hypnotist,* these commercials disorient our conscious mind, making us more susceptible to subconscious programming. They instill the idea that our immune systems are weak, and we are at risk of diseases; thus, we need their medication. This form of advertising manipulates our subconscious mind, programming it with fear and uncertainty, leading us to believe that we need the advertised drug for protection.

### The Subtle Art of Mind Programming

It's fascinating to note that our *three minds* — the conscious, subconscious, and analytical — play significant roles in our susceptibility to such subconscious programming. By changing our brain waves from beta to alpha, we can slow down our analytical mind, allowing us to access our subconscious mind. This state makes us highly suggestible to information, and it's in this state that commercials can program our subconscious mind.

Intriguingly, our brain waves slow down and we become more suggestible to information when we're shocked, traumatized, or experiencing strong emotions. Advertisers often take advantage of this state to program our autonomic nervous system. They typically air commercials late in the evening when our melatonin levels rise and our brain waves slow down, making us more suggestible.

### The Kaleidoscope: A Tool for Reprogramming

This understanding of the brain's susceptibility to programming led me on a quest to harness this power for positive change. I envisioned a tool that could induce a similar trance-like state, but instead of programming fear and uncertainty, it would program positive, empowering beliefs. My search led me to the *kaleidoscope*, a device that could induce trance and reprogram our subconscious mind with its mystical patterns.

### Mind Movies: Programming the Subconscious for Positive Change

Another powerful tool for reprogramming the subconscious mind is the *Mind Movie*. Created by Natalie and Glen Ledwell, Mind Movies are personalized media presentations designed to help individuals manifest their desired futures. They include images, written suggestions, and information designed to help individuals align their thoughts and actions with their future aspirations. Paired with the kaleidoscope, Mind Movies can bypass analytical thoughts and reprogram the subconscious mind with positive, empowering beliefs.

### The Science Behind Mind Movies

The power of Mind Movies lies in their ability to activate neural networks in the brain associated with our desired future. This activation helps us recognize and trust the new experiences that align with our vision. By focusing continually on our vision of the future and falling in love with it, we can align our energy and emotions with our desired reality. 

### Enhancing the Mind Movie Experience

To enhance the experience, individuals are encouraged to engage all their senses and create a three-dimensional, immersive experience. This process, called *dimensionalizing*, involves unfolding awareness into the scene and gradually adding sensory input to bring the scene to life. By investing energy and attention into our future vision, we can create a strong bond with that reality and manifest it in our physical lives.

### Integrating the Techniques

In my advanced workshops, participants integrate their Mind Movies with a kaleidoscope video during meditation. This technique helps individuals remember their future biologically, repeatedly activating and strengthening neural networks. As the brain starts to believe that the new future has already happened, the body begins to prepare for this new reality.

### The Potential and Power of Mind Movies

Mind Movies have shown their power in manifesting new homes, vacations, relationships, careers, cars, and even mystical experiences. They are not magic or sorcery but tools for conscious creation. By programming these subconscious thoughts and emotions, individuals can break free from old habits and unconscious reactions, paving the way to a brighter, more intentional future. 

By understanding and utilizing the power of the subconscious mind, we can shift from being passive consumers manipulated by fear-inducing commercials to empowered creators of our own future. This is the potential and power of Mind Movies.

## 09 | Walking Meditation

### Conscious Continuity: Bridging Meditation and Daily Life

Dwelling in elevated states achieved through meditation is often fleeting, a condition remedied by adopting **standing and walking** meditative practices. We must strive to carry the energy and awareness harvested during meditation into our daily lives, thereby *bridging the gap* between these two worlds.

### Walking into the Future: A Meditation for Movement 

The author introduces the concept of **walking meditation**, a practice that enables us to embody the elevated energy and frequency achieved during meditation, thereby maintaining a creative state and staying connected to our future dreams. Emphasizing the importance of a heart-centered state, the author invites us to cultivate elevated emotions that connect us to our future. As we open our focus and radiate this energy beyond our body, we set intentions for our day, week, or forthcoming years. 

### Step into Your Future Self: The Art and Science of Walking Meditation

Once we are fully grounded in the elevated emotions, we open our eyes and begin walking. Keeping our focus open, we remain in a trance state and connect to the images of our future, walking into our future as our future selves. The author encourages individuals to alter their stride, pace, posture, breathing, and movements to consciously embody the person they want to become. 

### Remembering the Future: Neural Circuitry and Walking Meditation

Through consistent practice of walking meditation, we can develop new habits and automatic patterns of thought, behavior, and emotion. This process upgrades neural circuitry, allowing the brain and body to resemble the future experience as if it has already happened. In this way, we are technically *remembering our future*. The author emphasizes the importance of remaining in a trance state during meditation in order to align the body with the future and create long-term memories. 

### Manifesting Your Destiny: Walking Meditation in Everyday Life

The author suggests practicing mindfulness and embodying the future self throughout the day. This can be done while waiting for someone, sitting in traffic, or standing in line at the grocery store. By redirecting thoughts and feeling grateful for the new life, we can accept, believe, and surrender to thoughts that align with the desired emotional state. This programs the autonomic nervous system into a different destiny and helps to stay present in the moment.

## 11 | Space-Time and Time-Space

### The Dance of Three-Dimensional Reality

Our lives are woven in the tapestry of a three-dimensional universe, where every interaction with people, places, and objects is a testament to our existence. We live within a sphere of time and space, ever-moving, ever-changing. Like dancers on the stage of life, we move our bodies through space, covering the distance between two points of consciousness, taking a measure of time. This dance gives us our sense of identity, shaped by our interactions and past experiences. 

Under the influence of stress, we draw on the energy around us, becoming further entrenched in the physical world, focusing more on matter, the known, and less on energy, the unknown. This heightened sense of alertness and fixation on time induces a state of incoherence and negative emotions, leading us to believe that we are our bodies, living in a particular place in space and time. In this state, we become addicted to the stress chemicals and feel enslaved to the world of knowns. 

### Journey into the Quantum World

To truly break free, we must dare to step into the unknown and let go of our attachment to the past. We must venture into the realm of the quantum world, the realm of the unknowns, the endless possibilities, the energy, and the multidimensional multiverse. Contrasting the predictable, matter-based, three-dimensional Newtonian world we inhabit, the quantum world offers a realm where time is eternal and there is no separation between past, present, and future. 

In this realm, everything is interconnected in a state of oneness or unity consciousness. By disconnecting from our physical bodies, our identity, and the external world, we can enter this quantum reality, becoming no body, no one, no thing, no where, and in no time. As we journey deeper into the quantum world, we realize that the laws of nature are an inward expression, where there is more time than space. 

### The Quantum Field: A Realm Beyond Time and Space

The quantum field is a realm of infinite possibilities and unknowns, where everything exists in the eternal now. As our consciousness merges with this unified field, we transition from the consciousness of some body to the consciousness of every body, from the consciousness of some one to the consciousness of every one. This realm is not governed by separation but by Oneness. 

In the quantum realm, the act of observation manifests potential energy into matter. When not observed, the matter reverts to energy and possibility. Shifting our attention from matter to energy, we gain a deeper understanding of the unified field. The quantum world is immaterial, defined by light, frequency, information, vibration, energy, and consciousness. 

### Crossing the Bridge to the Quantum Realm 

To transition from the known space-time universe to the unknown time-space multiverse, we must cross a bridge, which is the speed of light. When we become pure consciousness, we cross the threshold from matter to energy. Time is the nexus that connects the three-dimensional world to the fifth-dimensional world and beyond, demonstrating the interconnectedness of particles. 

### The Unified Field: The Fabric Connecting All

The unified field, a unifying field of information that exists beyond three-dimensional space and time, connects all matter. In this realm, everything is connected, and we experience less separation and more oneness. The more attention we pay to the unified field, the more aware we become. As our frequency increases, we pass through different levels of thoughts and emotions, gaining access to higher energy, information, consciousness, awareness, and mind. 

### The Path to Wholeness

Surrendering to the unified field and becoming one with it leads to less separation and more wholeness. This loving intelligence, both personal and universal, restores order and balance in our lives. On the other side of the threshold, there is no longer the separation of two points of consciousness, but rather oneness, where all possibilities exist. 

### The Power of Pure Thought

In the realm of pure thought, one is not limited by anything except their imagination. However, when one starts thinking about specific things, people, or places in known time and space, their awareness and energy are back in the realm of separation and three-dimensional reality. Every thought has a frequency, and when one thinks about pain, problems, or limitations, they vibrate at the same level as matter and particles. To move beyond this limitation, one must get beyond one's identity and past experiences. 

### The Eternal Now and the Unified Field

The unified field, where there is no separation and infinite time and possibilities exist, is the realm of oneness. In this realm, time is eternal and there are infinite spaces, dimensions, and realities to be experienced. The closer one is to the unified field, the less separation there is between oneself and everything material, leading to a perception of less space and time between oneself and others, objects, and even dreams. 

### Embracing the Unified Field

The unified field is a divine, loving intelligence that exists within and around us. By placing our attention on it and becoming more aware of it, we can experience more of it in our lives. This can manifest as serendipities, synchronicities, opportunities, coincidences, luck, and moments filled with awe. As we merge with the unified field, our perception of reality shifts, and we are able to perceive a greater spectrum of life. Through this process, we become more patient, forgiving, present, conscious, aware, giving, selfless, loving, and mindful. 

### The Space-Time, Time-Space Meditation

The Space-Time, Time-Space Meditation is a practice that helps us connect with the unified field. By consistently practicing this meditation, we can become more aligned with the unified field and express its qualities in our lives. Through this process, we learn that the discipline lies in surrendering to the unified field, trusting in the unknown, continuously letting go of control, and continuously deepening our connection with it.

## 12 | The Pineal Gland

### The Cosmic Conductor: The Pineal Gland

In the intricate symphony of our biology, one small player often goes unnoticed: the pineal gland. This tiny organ, no larger than a grain of rice, rests in the center of the brain, steadfastly conducting the rhythm of our lives. Its primary function is to produce melatonin, the hormone that dictates our sleep-wake cycle, the rhythm of our existence.

The pineal gland is more than a simple timekeeper. It also transforms mechanical stress into an electrical charge, acting as a piezoelectric transducer. In simpler terms, this gland behaves much like an antenna, tuning into frequencies beyond our physical perceptions and converting them into meaningful messages.

In the dance of day and night, when sunlight retreats, the pineal gland converts serotonin, the hormone of wakefulness, into melatonin, the harbinger of sleep. This cycle of hormonal production is delicately balanced, and when disturbed, can lead to sleep disturbances and other health issues.

Yet, the pineal gland's influence extends beyond the realm of sleep. It may hold clues to unlocking the full potential of the human brain, and understanding the profound inner experiences that shape our perception of reality.

### The Pineal Gland: An Inner Gateway

Activating the pineal gland is like tuning into a higher frequency of consciousness. It's akin to upgrading from a 1960s television screen to a 360-degree IMAX 3-D experience. When activated, it releases a blend of chemicals, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), leading to profound inner experiences such as time dilation, encounters with spiritual beings, and visions of interdimensional realities.

This activation involves a series of steps, including creating the piezoelectric effect, releasing metabolites, and delivering energy directly to the brain. This process allows the pineal gland to function as a cosmic antenna, picking up information from realms beyond our perceptual abilities.

### The Pineal Gland and the Spectrum of Reality

The activation of the pineal gland allows us to experience a broader spectrum of reality. It's like having a direct line to a cosmic information superhighway, a connection that leads to experiences more real than our everyday sensory-based reality.

These experiences have a profound impact on our perception of reality. When we consistently experience elevated states of consciousness, our internal state is altered, and we pay more attention to the images of reality created within us. This can lead to a broader perception of reality and a shift in our fundamental understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

### The Pineal Gland: A Link to the Ancient Past

The pineal gland is not a recent discovery. Ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians, recognized its importance and depicted it in their sacred symbols. Today, modern science is beginning to understand its significance, revealing its role in our perception of reality and our ability to connect with higher dimensions of consciousness.

To activate the pineal gland, one can practice a specific meditation during the peak melatonin levels between 1 A.M. and 4 A.M. This meditation involves activating the heart center, aligning all eight energy centers, and creating a bigger energy field. This process allows us to tune into higher vibrational realms and transform that information into vivid, meaningful imagery.

In the grand symphony of life, the pineal gland may be a small player, but its role is significant. It is the conductor, guiding us through the rhythms of our existence and offering us a glimpse into realms beyond our usual perceptions. By expanding our internal experiences and broadening our perception of reality, we can live from a place of love, oneness, and connection.

## 13 | Project Coherence: Making a Better World

### The Transformation of Consciousness

In the grand tapestry of life, we are at an intersection of old consciousness, characterized by fear, hatred, and competition, and a blossoming new consciousness, where Earth and all its inhabitants are undergoing a transformative process. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, the old must give way to the new for the world to function in harmony with the evolving consciousness. This transition is palpable in systems like journalism, which is grappling with a crisis of credibility. The frequency and energy of our time are increasing, causing anxiety, tension, and passion, and leading to the culmination of significant events.

### The Power of Collective Intention

Peace-gathering projects have shown tremendous promise in reducing negative elements such as crime, warfare, and terrorism. When groups of people unite with the intention of promoting peace and unity, their collective consciousness and energy can bring about considerable changes. An average reduction of over 70% in these negative incidents demonstrates the potency of a unified community.

### The Earth-Sun Interconnection

Our planet's relationship with the sun plays a significant role in our existence. As humans, we are electromagnetic beings deeply connected to the sun's energy, the Earth's energy, and the energy of fellow living species. The Earth's electromagnetic field shields us from the harmful effects of solar radiation and space weather. Solar cycles, occurring approximately every 11 years, can disrupt all living organisms and their activities. Astute observers have noted correlations between solar flares and significant political and social events, suggesting solar activity's influence on human behavior and society.

### The Pursuit of Coherence

If we are to navigate this transformational period successfully, it is essential to cultivate coherence - the state where the heart and brain are in harmonious rhythm, sending out a coherent electromagnetic signal. This coherence can be influenced by factors such as the Earth's electromagnetic field and frequencies like the Schumann Resonance, which can affect our balance, health, and nature as mammals. A study has shown that the absence of such frequencies can result in emotional distress and changes to our circadian rhythms.

### The HeartMath Initiative

The HeartMath Institute launched the Global Coherence Initiative (GCI) in 2008, endeavoring to activate humanity's heart and foster peace, harmony, and a shift in global consciousness. The organization believes that human health, thoughts, behaviors, and emotions are influenced by solar geomagnetic activity and that all humans affect the Earth's electromagnetic field. The HeartMath Institute has also created the Global Coherence Monitoring System (GCMS) to track changes in the Earth's magnetic field and measure global coherence.

### The Power of Emergence

The concept of emergence posits that a global community united in peace and coherence can impact the Earth's electromagnetic field and individuals' fields. This process, which creates more coherence in the brain and energy, involves regulating internal states of care, kindness, peace, love, gratitude, and appreciation. When individuals shift their attention from the physical realm to the energy world, they connect to the unified field where there is no separation between individuals. In this state, the heart acts as a catalyst to amplify coherence in the brain, leading to a more whole biology.

### From Individual Coherence to Community Coherence

The next frontier is community coherence. Imagine a community generating elevated energetic states and sending intentions for the highest good. This could lead to the merging of electromagnetic fields around each person's body and a shift in energy in the room, fostering community coherence. A collaboration with the HeartMath Institute showed that the energy produced in a room full of people could cause a coherent effect on individuals wearing heart rate variability (HRV) monitors. This effect was consistent across multiple events.

### Project Coherence: The Global Impact

Project Coherence, initiated by students, aims to see if the same measurable change in energy can be achieved on a global scale. Thousands of people generating elevated emotions for the entire world could potentially create a global impact. The project has seen increasing participation, with the goal of creating a stronger influence of peace and love worldwide.

In conclusion, we are in a time of transformation where the consciousness of unity, peace, and coherence can create significant positive changes in the world. The interplay between our personal fields, the Earth's electromagnetic field, and solar cycles underlines the deep connectivity of all living beings. By aligning our consciousness and energy with peace, unity, and coherence, we can contribute to the evolution of a new, sustainable consciousness.

## Afterword: Being Peace

### Embracing the Aura of Peace

We are urged to manifest peace throughout our existence, not merely during transient moments of meditation. Studies reveal a resurgence of violence and crime as peace initiatives conclude, suggesting that we must *transition from thinking to acting*. Commencing the day with an open heart, steeped in love, joy, gratitude, and kindness, we should sustain this energy, consciously choosing peace even amidst unsettling scenarios. This transformation from reactivity to peaceful action not only alters us but also our interaction with the world.

### Sculpting our Consciousness

By curbing reactive tendencies, we cease to trigger familiar brain circuits, leading to a *shift in our conditioning*. This allows us to transcend self-restrictive emotions, fostering a new state of being. Teaching our body to comprehend chemically what our mind grasps intellectually, we can thrive and metamorphose into embodiments of peace. Despite the initial discomfort due to a departure from years of conditioning, this journey into the unknown expands the realm of possibilities.

### Leadership and Collective Consciousness

True leadership demands a clear vision, a shift in energy, and an ability to inspire others to elevate their energy. The author conceives a future where a critical mass of people, acting with a unified consciousness, gives birth to a new species. True transformation occurs only when we alter our energy. This necessitates awareness, intent, presence, and constant attention to our inner states. Challenges are viewed as opportunities for growth, making us feel more alive.

### Harnessing the Power of Possibility 

Believing in the realm of possibility contradicts our genetically ingrained survival traits. It requires discarding old methods in pursuit of true greatness. By disrupting neural networks linked to negative emotions and activating those associated with positivity, we condition our mind and body to personify peace. With repetition, this becomes an automatic state of being.

### The Supernatural Beings

Collectively, we can shape a peaceful and prosperous future by leading with our hearts, elevating our energy, and tuning into higher frequencies of love and wholeness. The power of unified communities can influence reality through directed energy. To advocate for justice and peace, we must first discover peace within and demonstrate it to others. If everyone chose peace simultaneously, a collective future of positive change becomes possible. This involves inspiring others to shift from survival states to feelings of wholeness and connectedness.

### Evolutionary Transformation

The future of humanity rests on the evolution of a new collective consciousness. We must face the future with a new light, energy, and consciousness, allowing old structures and paradigms to crumble for something new to thrive. The power of the collective can lead to unity and truth, resulting in a universal stand for truth. The author envisages humanity on the precipice of a significant evolutionary leap, challenging us to embrace our true nature and transition from surviving to thriving. Envisioning a future prioritizing love, service, and care for one another and the Earth, we are urged to ask, "What would love do?" and strive to become supernatural beings.
