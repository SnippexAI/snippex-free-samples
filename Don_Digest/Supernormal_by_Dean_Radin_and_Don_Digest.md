# Supernormal: Science, Yoga, and the Evidence for Extraordinary Psychic Abilities by Dean Radin

## 01 Introduction

### Supernormal Abilities: Historical and Modern Perspectives

*Supernormal: Science, Yoga, and the Evidence for Extraordinary Psychic Abilities* by Dean Radin is an exploration of the extraordinary psychic abilities of historical figures like Buddha and Jesus. Radin discusses *reincarnation* and *yogic superpowers* along with their lack of recognition in mainstream science. He acknowledges the controversy surrounding the topic but argues its importance in understanding human potential, science-religion relationship, and humanity's future.

### Transformative Techniques and Human Desire

Radin introduces *transformative techniques* like yoga and meditation used historically to harness supernormal abilities. He explores humans' desire for transcendence, often sought through substances like alcohol and tobacco, and presents supernormal abilities as an alternative.

### Ancient Yoga Texts and Supernormal Powers

Radin discusses Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, describing the attainment of *supernormal powers* through meditation. He differentiates between the elementary *siddhis* associated with psychic phenomena and advanced siddhis like invisibility and levitation. These abilities, while considered mystical, are believed by a significant global population.

### Science and Supernormal Abilities

Radin presents empirical evidence from laboratory studies challenging the skepticism of mainstream science towards supernormal abilities. He argues that our understanding of human potential and reality necessitates exploring supernormal abilities and that the evidence supporting these abilities may require a revision of fundamental worldviews.

### Introduction to Supernormal

In the introduction to *Supernormal*, Radin questions who is more correct about siddhis: wisdom traditions or scientific orthodoxy. The book, focusing on controlled experimental evidence, argues in favor of genuine siddhis. The resistance to this evidence is also explored. The mystical and scientific ways of knowing are represented in Figure 1, indicating the book's exploration scope.

## 02 Yoga Explosion

### The Journey of Yoga to the West

The story of yoga's journey to the West begins with Swami Vivekananda, who introduced it to the Western world during his 1893 speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions. Despite a fair share of skepticism, Vivekananda's ideas soon found resonance with prominent figures of the time. The road to acceptance, however, was paved with challenges. Critics scoffed at the idea of yogic *siddhis* or superpowers. Yet, subsequent years saw the arrival of more Indian yogis and scholars in the West, who established centers and further boosted yoga's popularity. 

Paramahansa Yogananda and Jiddu Krishnamurti were among the influential figures of the 1920s. By the 1930s, figures like Pierre Bernard, aka "Omnipotent Oom," Americanized yoga, drawing a high-society clientele to his yoga retreat center in New York. Around the same time, Richard Alpert, later known as Ram Dass, penned "Be Here Now," a book that offered a Western perspective on the yogic path and gained wide influence.

### Yoga Enters the Mainstream

The 1950s and 1960s saw interest in yoga and meditation continue to grow, leading to the establishment of meditation rooms in the US Capitol and the Pentagon. The press began to emphasize the meditative aspect of yoga, particularly through the lens of Transcendental Meditation popularized by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the Beatles. 

Despite initial resistance from institutions like the Presbyterian Church who viewed these practices as "dangerously Roman Catholic" or "dangerously Buddhist," contemplative practice programs began to proliferate in many Presbyterian seminaries by the 2000s. These practices have now become mainstream even in evangelical Christian churches.

### The Power of Beliefs and Rise of Postural Yoga

The author explores how beliefs shape perceptions, using the example of fundamentalists who argue against practices like yoga. Nevertheless, yoga is now widely practiced in the West, embraced by millions as a means to improve mental and physical health. Scientific evidence supports the benefits of yoga and meditation, including improved immune function, reduced anxiety, and slower aging. 

The most well-known form of yoga today is postural yoga, which focuses on stretching, strength building, and relaxation. This form of yoga is a relatively new invention, influenced by Western practices such as Swedish gymnastics and British Army calisthenics. The rise of postural yoga can be attributed to figures like Tirumalai Krishnamacharya and Indra Devi.

### Yoga and the Brain: Mystical Experiences or Misfires?

There's an ongoing debate about the relationship between yoga and the brain. While neuroscience has found neural correlates for mystical and spiritual experiences, it can't definitively say whether these experiences are illusions or hallucinations. Obsessive interest in religious concepts may be diagnosed as "hyperreligiosity," a brain disorder.

Some speculate that advanced yogis and meditators may have misfiring posterior parietal cortexes, which could explain their experiences of oneness and transcendence. The author suggests that years of meditation could affect a yogi's posterior parietal cortex, causing them to experience the oneness of the universal Self.

### Brain-Mind Relationship and its Evolving Understanding

Scientific acceptance to study contemplative practices has grown, partly due to the Dalai Lama's influence. Research findings suggest that the brain and mind are more intimately connected than previously imagined, and the brain itself is more malleable. Buddhism's long-held belief about the mind's potential to bring about physical change is now being supported by neuroscience findings.

A study conducted by neuroscientists and Buddhist monks tested the monks' ability to hold detailed visual imagery in their minds. Experienced monks practicing Deity Yoga demonstrated a dramatic increase in performance on visual memory tasks, challenging previous beliefs about the limitations of mental imagery.

### The Importance of Multiple Independent Experiments

The author emphasizes the importance of conducting multiple independent experiments to gain confidence in the results. Just because a statistical test shows significant odds against chance, it does not necessarily mean that the effect being measured is what was expected.

Finally, the author notes that although postural yoga is widely accepted for its health benefits, its roots are a blend of ancient yoga asanas and Western-style gymnastics and calisthenics. The meditative side of yoga is also gaining recognition, but the ancient connection between meditation and superpowers is still considered taboo and avoided in polite conversation. The final chapters explore why this is so.

## 03 Other Realities

### Mystical Experiences: A Common Thread
The text discusses *perennialism*, a belief in a divine reality underpinning the mundane world. Mystics across cultures describe similar experiences, sparking debates among scholars about interpretations of these mystical happenings. 

### Pathways to the Divine
Seven key practices are identified for achieving *transpersonal development*, including ethics, meditation, and service. The text also finds a link between quantum theory and mystical reality.

### Shamanism: An Ancient Connection
Shamanism is explored, with *shamans* as intermediaries between realities through techniques like psychedelic drugs and meditation. A resurgence in these practices is noted, fueled by the psychedelic revolution of the 1960s.

### The Psychedelic Stigma
The criminalization of psychedelic plants, as societal norms were challenged, is mentioned. 

### DMT: The Spirit Molecule
Scientific studies on psychedelics, especially DMT, are highlighted. Rick Strassman's work on DMT-induced experiences is brought forth, revealing striking similarities with deep meditative states.

### Psilocybin and Transformation
Roland Griffiths' research shows long-term changes in psilocybin users, affirming yogis' claims of meditation-induced enlightenment. 

### Extreme Sports and Transcendence
The text discusses the link between extreme sports and transcendence, citing Maria Coffey's exploration of the spiritual lives of extreme athletes.

### Public Reception of Transcendence
While tales of shamanism, psychedelics, and extreme sports captivate the public with their elements of transcendence, academia often dismisses them when presented as reality.
